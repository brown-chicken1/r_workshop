## Motivation 



## Project objective

As part of the plan, part of Kutai Kartanegara Regency (Kabupaten Kutai Kartanegara) and Penajam North Paser Regency (Kabupaten Penajam Utara) in East Kalimantan will be carved out to create a new province-level planned city, and the capital will be relocated to a more central location within Indonesia. The plan is part of a strategy to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub. President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, said the relocation will help spread economic activities outside of the most-populous island of Java and narrow its income gap with the rest of the country.
