## Creating Proximity Maps

### Importing Necessary Data

1. We need to ensure that the data which we are utilising, is in a raster format, and we need to clip out unnecessary points.

*For all layers:*

2. For the selected layer, go to Vector > Geoprocessing > Clip, and select the study area Final_shape as the overlay layer, and the input layer as desired (for example, for airports, it will be AIRPORT_PT_50K). After creating, a temporary layer Clipped should be produced.
