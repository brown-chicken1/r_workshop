Hanchen is a third-year undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BSc(Econs)), with a second major in Data Science & Analytics. He is a recipient of the SMU Global Impact Scholarship and topped the Economics freshman cohort for AY2019/2020. Passionate about learning about new cultures, exploring new places and improving sustainability practices, Hanchen made the unusual choice to take this course as part of a possible idea to take a second degree in Smart City Management and Technology. He has interned at a fixed asset fund management firm from January to August 2021, and will do internships in policy and risk consulting, as well as decarbonisation strategy, in 2022. Hanchen aims to have a career as a consultant or data analyst in a consulting firm that makes data-driven decisions in the pursuit of net zero emissions or ESG compliance. Asides from his academics, he is the Vice President of SMU Emerging Markets, a finance and research club, and a student consultant at Thrive, a social consulting association serving non-profits.
