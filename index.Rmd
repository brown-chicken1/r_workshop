  **Task 2: Appropriate Site Selection**
  
  Use GIS analysis and multi-criteria evaluation method to identify site         suitability for the proposed new capital city by using the criteria below:
  
  1) It should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size
  2) It should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more     costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly
  3) It should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea    coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.
  4) It should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current   major settlement areas.
  5) It should avoid natural forest as much as possible.
  6) It should avoid areas prone to forest fire.
