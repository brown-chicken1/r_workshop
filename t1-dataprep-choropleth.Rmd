title: "Preparation of Choropleth and other qualitative and quantitative thematic maps."
description: |
  In this section, you will learn how to prepare qualitative and quantitative thematic maps using QGIS. You will also learn how to create a joint table by using the concept of georelational data model of GIS.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## 1. Objective: Creation of Appropriate Maps with these Data

* Population Density by District
  + Population of Adults
  + Population of Seniors
* Economic and Businesses
  + Agriculture
  + Mining
  + Commerce
* Transport and communication
  + Airports
  + Bus Terminals
  + Seaports
  + Roads
* Infrastructures
  + Buildings
  + Electricity
  + Water supply
* Environment and Hazard
  + Forests
  + Forest fire

## 2. Getting Started

>DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous section, add All_electricity, All_commerce, All_Watersupply, All_mining, map layer into the project.

Example of All_Electricity map layer

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch1.png")
```

## 3.0 Symbolising Qualitative GIS Data Layers
In this section, you will learn how to apply and use symbols to catergorise GIS data layers by using their corresponding qualitative data values.

Using all_water_supply layer, right click on layer > properties. The Layer properties should pop up. 

Select on Symbology > Change size to 10, marker to SVG marker and select water & tap symbol.

You should see something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch2.png")
```

Click on Apply and OK to close the window. You should see a screen similar to mine.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch3.png")
```

In the GIS and cartography fields, this map is known as a Point symbol map. The benefit of a GIS-based point symbol map is that it can be readily modified. An interactive GIS-based point symbol map is also available. You can move around the digital map and zoom in to see more information on the distribution.

>DIY: Using the steps you had learned repeat for Airports, Seaports, Bus Terminals, All_Electricity and use appropriate SVG Symbols for them.

## 4.0 Choropleth map using GIS

Choropleth mapping is the process of applying area patterns or graded colors to represent enumeration units such as countries, provinces, states, counties, or census units.

*   The method of data classification, areal symbolization, and the overall map design are the main concerns of choropleth mapping. Here are some of the general rules for choropleth mapping:

  + The data that is believed to be consistent across an entire enumeration unit.
  + Do not map totals because enumeration units vary in size. Ratios, rates, proportions, and percentages are examples of derived values.
  + The optimum classification method is determined by the data, the map reader, and the map's purpose.
  + When classifying data, make sure to cover the entire range of data and avoid overlapping class values. It is suggested that you use no more than six classes.
  + The colors and patterns used as class symbols must be easily recognized.

Using the INTERSECT_NIAGA (Commerce) layer, we can see that it's in point format. When creating the choropleth map, we like to see if the overall distribution in the study area.

Navigate to Processing Toolbox > Count Points in Polygon

In Polygon, select Final_Shape (The shape used as basemap for our Study Area)

In Points, select All_Commerce (The points that you want to count)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch4.png")
```

Note that you should skip invalid geometry to ensure smooth process.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch4_1.png")
```

Once everything is in Order, click on Run. It is also a good habit to look through the Logs to ensure there are no errors in the process.

Once it has successfully run, you will notice that there are a temporary file name Count, and if you check the table attributes, you are able to see that each polygon has a new column appended to it called num_points. This is the number of points that fall within the polygon.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch5.png")
```

Do remember to save the layer before proceeding as it is a temporary layer.

Once saved, click on layer > properties. The Layer properties should pop up. 

In the symbology table > change style to Graduated > Select desired colour ramp.

For Mode, select Natural Breaks (Jenks) and click classify. qGIS will automatically classify the values for you. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch6.png")
```

Once done, click on APPLY and OK. You should see a screen similar to mine.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ch7.png")
```

>DIY: Using the steps you had learned repeat to create choropleth maps for Population Density by district and Forest Fire.
