      "contents": "\r\n1. Preparation of Road Layers\r\nIn the OSM layer selected, we need to filter out the Primary, secondary and tertiary roads for analysis.\r\nImport the road layer that we had created before using the process.\r\nWe need to filter by the road attributes. Right click ont he road layer and select > “open attribute table”.\r\nIn the attribute table, we select the road concerned using the following commands by clicking on the “Select by Expression” menu:\r\nPRimary and Trunk: “fclass” = ‘motorway’ or “fclass” = ‘motorway_link’ or “fclass” = ‘trunk’ or “fclass” = ‘trunk_link’ or “fclass” = ‘primary’ or “fclass” = ‘primary_link’\r\nSecondary and Tertiary: “fclass” = ‘secondary or “fclass” = ’secondary_link’ or “fclass” = ‘tertiary’ or “fclass” = ‘tertiary_link’\r\n\r\n\r\nWe verify the roads have been selected; there should be elements selected in the table:\r\n\r\nWe save the layers as a GeoPackage layer. Right click on the layer with the selection > Save Selected Attributes As. In the window that pops up, select the GeoPackage for the project but save the layer as “Primary Roads”\r\nRepeat all the above steps for “secondary and tertiary” roads.\r\n2. Visualisation of Road Layers\r\nTo see the hierarchy better, colour the motorways and primary roads yellow and increase their width. Right Click on the “Primary Road” layer and go to “Symbology” on the panel that opens. Click on the “Simple Line” and in the window that opens,\r\nchange the colour to a dark shade of blue.\r\nchange the stroke width to 0.8mm.\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeat the previous step for the other 2 layers (Secondary and Tertiary roads, and all roads)\r\nThe colour for secondary roads should be a dark shade of green with a width of 0.5mm\r\nThe colour for other roads should be a dark brown with a width of 0.3mm\r\n\r\nFollowing that, follow instructions to plot road density below.\r\n3. Visualising Road Density\r\nFor the site survey analysis, a plot of road length against fixed distance will be used to visualise road density.\r\nFirst, we need to merge adjacent road segments together in order to prevent the number of intersections from being overstated. We first go to Vector >Geoprocessing > Dissolve, and in the window that opens, select the OSM road layer as the input layer.\r\n\r\nIn the reuslting temporary layer, open the dissolved layer’s atribute table, there should only be one row of data.\r\nFollowing that, we go to the Processing Toolbox on the bottom righthand corner, and search for “Multipart to Singlepart”\r\n\r\nIn the resulting window, just select the newly dissolved layer and click “Run”.\r\n\r\nThe final layer that is created, would be soon utilised to create density map. We save the single roads as a new layer in the GeoPackage file.\r\nWe can then create a grid. Go to Vector > Research Tools > Create Grid. Fill up the attributes as according to the below image. Make sure distance is set to 5000m, and then the shape type should be a hexagon.\r\n\r\nEach cell of the grid is a unit in which the density of the road network there will be calculated, with the measure of the density being length / 5x5km hexagonal area.\r\nwe also need to clip the grid to the study area. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip on the top bar and select the input layer as the temporary grid layer an the bottom layer as the study area layer as defined before, following the screenshot and then click run.\r\n\r\nThe completed grid should look like this.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we use the Vector > Analysis Tools > Sum Lines Length to calculate the total length of the lines in the polygon. Ensure that the roads are the input layer and the other polygon vector layer is set to the hexagon.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done we need to change the visual representation on the new temporary layer that is created. Go to right click on the layer > Properties and “Symbology”, change the symbology to “Graduated”, and the columns are set as “Length”. Classify the column by clicking on the classify button and then the values will appear. Leave it as equal count and press apply then close the window.\r\n\r\nNow, the road density map is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nGIS Report\r\nBased on the analyses conducted as explained above, we believe that the areas in light green would be suitable areas for the new capital city of Indonesia, and we have come to the final decision of the area north of Samarinda, highlighted in dark green.\r\nThis area is relatively flat and away from the flood-prone part of Samarinda, while also not being near forested land, both dry shrubs and primary and secondaary forest layers, or any forest fires. In addition, it is also close to two airports that have the potential for expansion, as well as being close to an existing major settlement (Samarinda).\r\nWe acknowledge that this differs from various online sources that have rumoured the new city to be between Balikpapan and Samarinda. While we are unsure of the exact rationale behind their decision to locate the new capital between Balikpapan and Samarinda, based on the evidence that we have gathered, and the weights we put on different factors, we believe that our weightage of environmental risks would be relatively higher. Our exact rationale and report is outlined as follows.\r\nTo get to this conclusion,\r\nMethods\r\nWe had used Raster-based GIS Multiple‐Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA), which integrates raster-based GIS modelling as well as the Analytical Hierarchical Process.\r\n1. Results from Raster-based GIS modelling\r\nThe 8 criteria that were set out on the project brief were, quoted verbatim: > It should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size\r\nThe decision criteria should be in such a way that the threshold allows for at least a 4500 to 5500 hectare area to be selected. This would work out to approximately a 5km x 5km area assuming the site is shaped like a square.\r\n\r\nIt should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.\r\n\r\nFrom the DEM layer, the gradient of the land was calculated. Areas with lower gradient scored higher, and areas with a steeper gradient scored lower. The elevation itself was excluded from the analysis, as it is the change in elevation, rather than the absolute elevation, that matters.\r\n\r\nMost of the terrain is rlatively flat and thus scores very well. Looking to the southwest of the map, there are a few areas that are deemed more unsuitable because of the hilly terrain, as further inland west into the study area, it starts to get into mountaineous territory. As it is linked to an increase in construction costs, this area might a potential concern.\r\n\r\nIt should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the site survey analysis from task 1, there are no major volcanoes in the study area, therefore they were not incorporated into the analysis. The major areas of consideration were the sea coast and the 2 major rivers, the Mahakam River and the Balikpapan Bay, which a buffer region was implemented. The smaller regions in the study area did not have a buffer.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, the major areas of concern are the area near the Mahakam River and the associated streams surrounding it. However, as the river cover as a percentage of the study area is not very large, there still is a high proportion of area that is still suitable, going by this criteria alone.\r\n\r\nIt should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, only urban settlement areas were considered in the analysis. Therefore, being close to any settlement areas outside of Samarinda and Balikpapan city limits would not negatively impact the site suitability score.\r\n\r\nAs we are unable to build exactly on the urban settlement, the region that is exactly on the settlement is classed as 0. Increasingly, it is obvious that most areas of the map score higher than 0.5, due to their proximity to the large cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda with the suitability falling as the distance increases.\r\n\r\nIt should avoid natural forest as much as possible.\r\n\r\nNatural forests from the data include Primary and Secondary Dry and Wet Forests, Primary and Secondary Mangrove Forests, Secondary Swamp Forests and shrubbery. Although a check on internet websites show that majority of the land in Samarinda had already been deforested, including the land labelled as “Shrubbery”, we decided to go with a more conservative estimate and include shrubbery in our data analysis, as we would want to avoid those areas as much as possible to preserve whatever natural vegetation there is left.\r\n\r\nMuch of the map area is covered in forest, except for some narrow strips on the west and in the north of the study area. Although not all of it is primary forest as there has been a large scale of deforestation, we believe that due to the urgent need to restore forests in East Kalimantan province, as well as to avoid developing on natural areas as much as possible, we have been rather conservative in our estimates.\r\n\r\nIt should avoid areas prone to forest fire.\r\n\r\nDue to climate change, deforestation and poor forest management, the impact of forest fires on potential land suitability sites has gotten stronger. We have identified a 2km buffer around the forest fire in order to ensure a sufficient margin of safety.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, where there are forests in the above picture, there are also high occurrences of forest fires. The only areas where this does not occur, are close to the mountaineous regions in the West and the North. The coastal areas seem to be more prone to forest fires as can be seen from the higher density of points, but given that many forest fires in Indonesia are actually man-made, this could be a plausible explanation.\r\n\r\nIt should be highly accessible via road transport.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost areas score well on this, because of a wide variety of roads tht can see further development to support the capital city. Again, the exception is in the more mountaineous regions in the Southwest of the study area, and some regions between Balikpapan and Samarinda.\r\n\r\nIt should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).\r\n\r\n\r\nA 3km buffer was constructed outside of the airport to account for noise abatement limitations. Even so, most of the study area near the coastal areas are highly accessible to airports, with the exception of the area exactly between Balikpapan and Samarinda. The South of the study area has access to only one airport (Balikpapan Airport) while there are 3 airports in the north. Further research and surveys done in task 1 found that 2 of those 3 airports are either decommissioned or very lightly utilised. However, they could still be refurbished without incurring excessive capital expenditure if the situation calls for it, instead of contructing a new airport.\r\nSeaports are located closest to the rivers, but the presence of river proximity would work against them contributing significantly favourably to the site selection.\r\n2. AHP Selection Matrix\r\nBased on secondary research sources, our team has identified the prioritisation of issues as follows:\r\nSTILL TO CHANGE!\r\nGradient of slope – 19.9%\r\nDistance from river – 19.0%\r\nDistance from known forest fire hotspots – 13.4%\r\nRoad accessibility – 13.0%\r\nDistance from forests – 14.5%\r\nDistance from urban settlements – 10.5%\r\nDistance to Airport – 6.3%\r\nDistance to seaport – 4%\r\n2.1 Reasoning for Ranking\r\nThe gradient of the slope was designated as the most significant criteria, because of the consequences of disregarding slope, and the economic costs involved with it. Construction on slopes have issues with construction of foundations and excavation of soil, as compared to flat land. This could lead to an increase in cost of construction of as much as 40%, as compared to building on flat land. Given that the city is supposed to be constructed from scratch, and the study area has plenty of other areas which are not as steeply sloped, it reasons that there would be a significant amount of alternative sites to be selected. Furthermore, building on slopes could have long-term consequences such as an increased risk of natural disasters such as landslides, especially when poor drainage systems and inadequate construction materials are involved. As such, slope gradients would obtain the highest weightage in our model, due to its cost outlays and potential risk for introducing new disasters post-build.\r\nSecond is the distance from river or major coastlines. The main rationale for moving the capital city away from Jakarta is due to its proximity to the coastline and the type of soil leading to the city being susceptible to floods and sinking, compounded by its traffic management problems which make natural disaster management and mitigation more complicated. Therefore, it is essential that the new site avoids this possibility to the fullest extent otherwise it would defeat the purpose of building the city there in the first place. This is compounded by there being regular floods in the Mahakam River, to the extent that there are rice paddies built in the surrounding areas to take advantage of this. Given the systemic problems that the municipal governments face, such as a lack of leadership and political will to tackle the flooding platform, the unwillingness of people to relocate worship facilities near flooded areas, and the sheer amount of people to relocate , it is important that these issues are avoided entirely. Thus, river / coast proximity also get a high weightage.\r\nThe next few factors are related to the proximity to known forest fire hotspots, the road accessibility and distance from forests, all of which receive relatively similar weightage. Forest fires can certainly have disastrous effects on the city, but it is possible to mitigate their effect through a comprehensive road network, and other methods like building small and simple canals. These canals can be done on existing agricultural land and ditches to act as firebreaks, which has been done in Kalimantan province already.\r\nSimilarly important factors, however, are to ensure a comprehensive road network, which would facilitate forest fire mitigation methods, and avoidance of areas that are near the forest in the first place, as these areas have the potential to become fire risk areas especially if deforestation occurs. This would be secondary to actually avoiding forest fire prone areas in the first place, as road infrastructure can and will be built as the city expands.\r\nIncluding the shrubbery layer in the forest layer was important to the analysis, because literature has discovered that the nature of these low density shrubs are dry vegetation, which are at the greatest risk of triggering forest fires. Furthermore, there is a need to build in resilience to the future capital city by reducing the incentive for deforestation as much as possible, since the more fire-resistant primary forests areas have been greatly reduced as a result of deforestation. It is estimated that only 3% of peatlands are still fire-resistant primary forest, and researchers advocate for their protection to the fullest extent.\r\nThe last two factors, our team believes, are “good-to-haves”. The distance to airport is measured at only 7%, because of the availability of alternatives like the 2 major airports at Balikpapan and Samarinda, which already have established air networks. While it is not unusual to have airports that are a long way from the city centre, for example Beijing Capital Airport is almost 30km away from downtown and Pudong Airport at 45km, it is still weighted above the seaport due to its importance in attracting investment and convenience for visiting dignatories. As the size selection is only 4500-5500 hectares, it is also unlikely that there would be an economic case for a construction of an entirely new airport to solely serve the capital. However, relative to the environmental concerns that any proposed development in Kalimantan needs to contend with, we believe that land and sea port proximity is relatively less important.\r\n3. Implementing the Analysis\r\n Based on the analysis, several areas, mostly clustered around the regions in the north and southwest, have been identified as suitable locations. Based on a threshold value of 0.6 as acceptable, the suitable sites are outlined in green.\r\nWe have identified the most suitable site there. Although it does not score the highest on the scale, areas that score 9 or 10 are significantly smaller and do not fit the 4500 to 5500 hectare definition that is required of the location. Furthermore, although the mountaineous area at the southwest of the study do quite well, it is likely that in order to get to that area in the first place, one would still need to traverse steep slopes, which would expense time and resources.\r\nIn view of the size constraints, therefore, we believe that the chosen area would be the most suitable.\r\nIt does not have steep slope or is close to rivers or coastline and hence would not be susceptible to flooding.\r\nIt is one of the few areas with low incidences of forest fire, and also would have less environmental destruction because the locations of forests are not there.\r\nWhile it is far away from seaports they are not weighted highly in our analysis, and there are 2 existing airports which can be redeveloped for the capital’s needs, and one more international airport that serves Samarinda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Population and Demographic\r\n1.1 Population Density by District\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly the most densely populated areas are located near the urban centres of Samarinda and Balikpapan, with the general trend of areas becoming less densely populated the further inland. However, the area north of Samarinda, and between Balikpapan and Samarinda, stands out as having population density of around 36-125 people per square kilometre. These places have some form of human settlement around them but are not too densely populated indicating the presence of highly urbanised areas.\r\nThe region that had the highest proportion of adults are close to Kota Balikpapan, at areas Prapatan (56.7%), Telaga Sari (56.1%), Telemow, Gunungsari Ilir and Damai Baru (all at 56%). Generally, however, as highlighted by the dark green areas, which indicate regions with the highest proportion of adults of 54.5% to 67.7%, most of those areas are clustered near the cities of Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan, while the areas with the smallest proportion of adults, at 46.5% to 50.1%, are located in the outlying regions, for example Santan Ulu in the north of the study region, Tani Baru in the east near the river delta, and Penajam, near the Southwest. These percentages are significant because they provide insight into the demographics of the region - a place with a higher proportion of adults would likely have a larger workforce, after controlling for the population density. Places with higher proportion of seniors or elderly, who are not considered economically productive, would mean more social support needed to empower them, and thus be a less suitable location.\r\nProp. of AdultsSupplementing the previous point, a survey was also conducted on the proportion of seniors in the study area. It was found that the proportion of seniors ranged from only 1.7% to 11.7%. The highest proportions were found in areas indicated by the dark blue on the map where the proportion ranged from 5.7% to 11.7%. There was no particular geographic distribution for these highest proportions, which were Desa Argo Sari (11.7%), Lung Anai (9.3%), Pelabuhan (8.9%), Sungai Bawang (8.6%) and Bukit Raya (8.5%). Generally, there is also no specific trend in the geographical distribution of seniors, except that most of the areas with more seniors are clustered north of Balikpapan.\r\nProp. of Seniors2. Economic and Businesses\r\n2.1 Agriculture\r\nThe overall distribution of agricultural areas is shown as below:\r\n ### 2.1.1 Sawah - Integrated Rice or Paddy Field\r\nAgrisawah, or paddy fields, are found mostly within the area of Samarinda as well as Kutai Kartanegara regency, close to the Mahakam River. We hypothesise that the low-lying area, makes it susceptible to floods and thus it becomes a better region to have rice paddies. This contrasts with the relatively higher-lying area in Balikpapan and even south, which would be more suited for conventional crops that do not require an extremely large amount of water.\r\n2.1.2 Forest Plantation\r\nMost forest plantations are found within the inner area at higher elevation, possibly because they take longer to grow and are more vulnerable to damage caused by floods.\r\n2.1.3 Dryland and Mixed Dryland Farming\r\nDryland and mixed dryland farming are found closer to the coast, distributed relatively evenly throughout the study area, though they tend to cluster on the city fringes of both Kota Balikpapan and Kota Samarinda which are highlighted grey. This is not very surprising given that the farms are likely to serve people living in the city.\r\n2.2 Mining\r\n\r\nMining areas are mostly close to the coast, south of Samarinda. They are especially common at the Sanga Sanga district. Upon further research, the area close to Sanga Sanga has had various disagreements and protests among villages as a result of the mining activities. Furthermore, companies that had left the area did not fill up mine pits, causing floods and terrain damage whenever it rains and reducing the suitability of the land for other activities.\r\nhttps://www-mongabay-co-id.translate.goog/2018/08/18/tolak-perusahaan-tambang-warga-sanga-sanga-upacara-kemerdekaan-indonesia-di-area-konsesi/?_x_tr_sl=id&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-GB&_x_tr_pto=nui https://betahita-id.translate.goog/news/detail/6080/forum-sanga-sanga-tutup-tambang-pt-abn-pulihkan-lingkungan.html.html?_x_tr_sl=id&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui,sc\r\n2.2 Commerce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit easily generates various employment opportunities in other areas such as transport and logistics, banking, and retail. Commerce overall is an essential component of national development and wealth creation.\r\nIn our analysis, the distribution of commerce is correlated to urban settlements in the study area. The darker shades are those with more commerce in place. We should pick an area that has existing commerce so that we can boost economic development in that area.\r\n3. Transport and Communication\r\n3.1 Airports\r\n\r\nExcluding decommissioned airports, there are 4 airports that are around the study area. Most of the airports are located close to the coast. Most of the airport runways are also in the north-eastern and south-western direction, presumably to take advantage of the direction of monsoon winds.\r\nFrom northerly to southerly, the airports are:\r\nBandara Tanjung Santan: The runway is in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction. However, the airport appears to be decommissioned from Google satellite images, although the infrastructure appears to still be present.\r\nMuara Badak Pujangan Airport: The runway is in the heading of 01 and 19, and is owned by the LNG company Badak NGL, suggesting that it’s not used for regular flights.\r\nAji Pangeran Tumenggung Pranoto International Airport: The main airport in Samarinda; the runway is in heading of 40/220 and it serves exclusively domestic destinations with a range of flights by 7 airlines. The runway is 2.25 km long.\r\nSultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Sepinggan Airport: The airport in Balikpapan. It is the busiest airport in Kalimantan province and again has domestic flights to other Indonesian locations. Its 2.5km runway is in headings of 70 and 250.\r\n3.2 Bus Terminals\r\n\r\nThe bus terminals are located within the major cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda, with two of them being outside the city limits. The first bus terminal outside those city limits is the terminal in Tenggarong, the regency capital of Kudai Kartanegara. The second bus terminal outside those city limits is the terminal in Muara Jawa on the Eastern coast, which connects to a seaport, which has routes to Pare Pare, Sulawesi.\r\n3.3 Seaports\r\n\r\nThere are several seaports, wharves and harbours stretching from the coast to inland. Both cities Samarinda and Balikpapan have a system of wharves within the rivers that run through the middle of the city. There are also seaports near the bus terminal in Muara Jawa, which connect to other Indonesian islands such as Sulawesi. Some ports, namely one at Tanjung Santan, have been removed because they are primarily for LPG cargo and are privately owned , and not for passenger use.\r\n3.4 Roads\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road network naturally gets more dense around the urban areas of Balikpapan and Samarinda. There are a few major throroughfares highlighted in blue on the map, indicating primary roads and motorways. They primarily connect Balikpapan with Samarinda, and from Samarinda, there is a road further inland tnto Kalimantan out of the study area.\r\nSimilarly the secondary road network is also relatively well developed, especially along the coastal areas in the north of the study area.\r\nHowever, some areas remain relatively untouched, especially the west and southwest of the study area where the terrain is more hilly and they are far from the urban population centres.\r\n4. Infrastructure\r\n4.1 Infrastructure - Buildings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExisting Infrastructure such as buildings plays an important role as it shows the necessary buildings needed for people to live in. We have analysed the distribution of buildings throughout the area. The darker shades are those with more building infrastructure in place.\r\nThere are various pros and cons to consider when picking an area that has this basic infrastructure in place. Pros: Basic infrastructure buildings able to pick up the development process more quickly. Cons: Certain infrastructure may require demolition to make way for more development.\r\n4.2 Infrastructure - Electricity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectricity plays an important role and is a necessity in everyday life. We have analysed the distribution of electricity and power throughout the area. The darker shades are those with more electricity infrastructure in place. We should pick an area that has this basic infrastructure in place.\r\n4.3 Infrastructure - Water Supply (distributors)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater is a requisite resource for business. Without regular or continuous access to clean water, businesses either have to raise prices, shut down or both. Industries that rely on water for operations or manufacturing are the most vulnerable and most at risk.\r\nThe study analyzes the location and distribution of water supply (distributors) in the Study Area. We should pick an area that is accessible to water supply to keep operations running.\r\n5. Environment and Hazard\r\n5.1 Forest Fire\r\nTo measure the extent and severity of forest fires from 2014-2019, counts of forest fires were being added to each polygon (districts) on the study area GIS map. The intensity of red signifies the number of forest fires that occurred in each polygon/district from 2014-2019, where the higher intensity of red signifies high frequency of forest fires while a lighter shade of red indicates lower frequency of forest fires happening in the district. White would be used to indicate no forest fires occurred in that district from 2014-2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2 Earthquake\r\nWe mapped out the seismic waves from the recent 2021 Sulawesi earthquake of magnitude of 6.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is higher tendency of earthquake in Sulawesi as major fault lines are found there which gives rise to earthquakes (https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-021-00197-5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile our study area is not near the epicenter of the earthquake, we can see that the seismic waves are able to be felt in our study area. We can see that the seismic waves are coming from the coastal area in the western side of our study area. This may give rise to potential typhoons and/or tsunamis due to the seismic waves.\r\n5.3 Major rivers with digital elevation\r\nFor digital elevation, the DEM map gave a range of -77m under sea level to 289m above sea level. We would want to avoid areas with low elevation and especially if it is close to water bodies (lakes and rivers) so as to avoid flash floods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirstly, we made any area below sea level as blue to signify that these areas are either filled with water or are extremely likely to. Areas with less than 10m above sea level are considered dangerously low-lying and susceptible to flash floods. Hence we considered anything below 10m as dangerous (red-orange) and anything above 15 would be considered relatively safe in the near future. Any area with an elevation of above 50m and 100m would be considered “mountainous areas”, hence we have these areas in light and dark shades of yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also added layers of all major rivers and lakes in our study area and changed all their colours to dark blue. We can see that the areas around the lakes and rivers are mostly low-lying with elevation of around 10m. Unsurprisingly, the coastal areas of the study area are all below 10m elevation and the elevation would get higher the further we are from the coastal areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northern region of the study area, while does have some area well above 50m, is surrounded by a large portion of low lying area Even close proximity around smaller streams are not suitable for settlements as the elevation is around 15m which would still run the risk of a flash flood during heavy rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The Layer properties should pop up.\r\nSelect on Symbology > Change size to 10, marker to SVG marker and select water & tap symbol.\r\nIf done correctly this should show:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf done correctly this should show:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf coming from section “Create Overlay Map”, follow instructions until here. There is no need to generate the choropleth map in the previous section. Otherwise, continue with the analysis.\r\n\r\n4. Creating the Choropleth Map\r\nUsing the INTERSECT_NIAGA (Commerce) layer, we can see that it’s in point format. When creating the choropleth map, we like to see if the overall distribution in the study area.\r\nNavigate to Processing Toolbox > Count Points in Polygon\r\nUnder Polygon, select Final_Shape (The shape used as basemap for our Study Area)\r\nUnder Points, select All_Commerce (the points to be used as inputs into choropleth map)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is invalid geometry error, go to the Processing Toolbox on the bottom right hand corner of the page and type “Fix geometries”. In the tool that comes up, select the “Fixed Geometry” tool and change the input layer to the Polygon (Final Shape) layer. If the data processing was done properly in the data preparation and cleaning stage, this should not occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on Run to start the process.\r\nA temporary file named Count will appear. Each value in the column NUM_POINTS is the number of points in the polygon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe save this layer as a laye in the GeoPackage file by right clicking on the layer, selecting “Save Feature As”, and choosing the GeoPackage which we are using for the project. Ensure the correct CRS is set (EPSG:23845).\r\nOnce saved, click on layer > properties.

In the window that opens, select “Create Calculated Field”.\r\n\r\nIn the window that opens, make sure ‘Create a New Field’ is selected. Enter “POPULATION” into the field name and sum up all the population layers “U5”, “U10” etc. The code should be something like “U5” + “U10” + “U15” … etc, taking into account that one column equals to the number of people in that column.\r\nWhen this is done, we need to calculate the area of each district.\r\nWe repeat the step before but instead of “POPULATION”, type “AREA”. In the field window, type “AREA”. Then click Run to create the calculated field.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we create a new field called “DENSITY”. Repeat the following step but in the field window type “POPULATION” / “AREA”, this will divide the population by area to get density.\r\nIf all is done this should come up:\r\n\r\nNow, we can follow the steps in the previous section to generate the choropleth map, starting from section 4.

Selection of Required Data\r\nThe datasets that are being used for the project include:\r\nTopographical data from here: https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html. Data of Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda, Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara are to be downloaded.\r\nThe https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/download-shapefile-shp-batas-desa.html comprises the population and demographic data.

(BATAS_DESA_DESEMBER_2019_DUKCAPIL_KALIMANTAN_TIMUR.shp)\r\nWe need to select the suitable study area since the layer would contain the regencies, districts and sub-districts for the entire province of East Kalimantan. Right click on the layer, open Attribute Table and first we filter by the “KAB_KOTA” column. Open the “Select Fetures using an Expression” field and enter the following: “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KUTAI KARTANEGARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA BALIKPAPAN’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘PENAJAM PASER UTARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA SAMARINDA’.\r\n\r\nIn the resultant selected layers, we toggle editing on the layer and then copy the selected areas and paste it as a temporary layer by going to Edit > Paste Features As > Temporary Scratch Layer.\r\nRepeat the steps above, but with the filtering by the specific districts as mentioned in the project brief:\r\nAll sub-districts and district of Kota Balipapan, Kota Samarinda\r\nKutai Kartanegara: Anggana, Loa Janan, Loa Kulu, Marang Kayu, Muara Jawa, Samboja, Sanga Sanga, Sebulu Tenaggarong, Tenggarong Seberang and Muara Badak.\r\nNorth Penajam Paser (Penajam Paser Utara) Regency: Babulu, Penajam, Sepaku and Waru.\r\n\r\nThis time we have to filter on the column ‘KECAMATAN’ instead.\r\nWe can manually select the districts and sub-districts by sorting by the “KECAMATAN” column. We select all the districts and sub-districts that do NOT fall into the ones listed above, and then invert the selection using the invert selection tool.\r\nFollowing that, we save the selection into a new temporary layer using the steps above (Edit > Paste Features As > Temporary Scractch Layer)\r\nBefore proceeding there are some geometrical errors which we have to be fixed.\r\nTo fix this, go to the Processing > Toolbox on the right and search for Fixed Geometries.\r\n\r\nSelect the newly imported layer and press “OK” in the resultant window.\r\n\r\nSave the resultant layer in a GeoPackage format. Click on the newly created temporary layer, go to Export > Save Features As. In the resultant window, select the format GeoPackage and then create a new GeoPAckage file. Name the layer “FinalShape”, leave all other features as intended, before saving. Make sure projection is EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1).\r\n\r\nClipping Layers into Study Area\r\nThe processing of each layer will differ according to their data type. We have sorted the layers that have been used into the following categories:\r\nPoints\r\nTOPONIMI_PT_50k\r\nTERMINALBUS_PT_50k\r\nForest Fire (Titik Api Hotspot se-Indonesia Tahun 2019)\r\nCommerce (NIAGA_PT_50k)\r\nElectricity and Network:\r\nGENLISTRIK: Electricity,\r\nKABELLISTRIK: Power cable,\r\nMENARALISTRIK: Electric Tower,\r\nMENARATELPON: Tower Phone,\r\nPANCARTV: TV Transmitter,\r\nPANCARRADIO: Radio Transmitter\r\nWater Supply (Distributors)\r\n\r\nArea\r\nMining Areas (TAMBANG_AR_50k)\r\nNon-Agricultural Forest Areas (Tuplah_Kalimantan_Timur_2019.shp)\r\nAgricultural Areas (Tuplah_Kalimantan_Timur_2019.shp)\r\nSettlements (PEMUKIMAN_AR_50k)\r\nMixed\r\nAirport (Both point and area)\r\nAIRPORTS_LN_50K and AIRPORTS_PT_50k\r\n\r\nLines\r\nRoads (gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp)\r\nRaster\r\nDigital Elevation Model (EM SRTM 30M KALIMANTAN TIMUR.tif)\r\nProcessing Polyline (Road Layer)\r\nImport the layer (gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp).\r\nThere is a need to join incomplete roads. Examine each road segment closely and find out which road segments can be joined, for example roads which go above the bridge.\r\nThis will result in the intersection points being overstated when conducting site survey analysis. While it may not be possible to fix every road, most roads where this issue presents itself, are located along the coast or over bridges.\r\n\r\nWe need to clip the road to the study area. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip, make sure the newly imported road layer is input as the Input Layer, and the layer to be used as a clip is the FinalShape layer (Overlay Layer)that had been prepared.\r\n\r\nSave the temporary layer as a GeoPackage layer with the correct CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and make sure under the “Geometry” tab, the data type is changed to “Line” and the “Include Z values” is not checked.\r\nFollowing that, toggle editing on the layer by clicking on the pencil icon. Make sure the selection method is “Select Features” and not other selection methods.\r\nSelect the 2 road segments that are supposed to be joined together.\r\n\r\nClick on “Merge Selected Features” in order to merge the 2 line segments together to form a single feature, which we can then extend in order to touch the 2 edges of the line.\r\n\r\nPost-merge we have to re-select the merged segment which has become a single feature by clicking on the line segment. Following that we click on the “Reshape Feature”.\r\n\r\nWe click on the edge of one line and then drag it to the start of the other line, this will join the 2 line segments together to form a complete road.\r\n\r\nRepeat this for all segments that have been found to have missing road segments.\r\n\r\nRemove all the previous temporary layers created by right clicking on them and selecting “Delete Selected Layer”.\r\nSave the newly created road layer by right clicking on it in the menu and selecting Save Features As, and in the resultant box that comes up, ensure that the GeoPackage file that the base map layer was selected, is selected under the file name and the layer name is set to “Roads”, and the map CRS is set to EPSG:23845.\r\nProcessing Area (Polygon) Data - Topographical Data\r\nThe area data needs to be merged into a single layer for analysis.\r\nWe first open up the characteristic of concern, for example, urban settlements layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we need to clip the layers so that they only overlap our area of study. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip, make sure the newly imported road layer is input as the Input Layer, and the layer to be used as a clip is the FinalShape layer (Overlay Layer) that had been prepared. Repeat this for each layer.\r\nNB: If the geometries are invalid it is required to use the “Fix Geometries” tool from the Processing > Toolbox (CTRL+ALT+T) before moving forward with the analysis.\r\nImage was used to process road section data but the methodology is the sameThe completed, clipped layers should look like this:\r\n\r\nThe different areas then need to be combined together. Go to the Processing toolbox on the bottom right hand corner of the page and select “Merge vector layers”.\r\nIn the resulting window, select the desired layers to be merged, for example:\r\n\r\nWe keep the CRS as it is; we will change the CRS when we export as a GeoPackage.\r\nAfter merging, the layers should appear as this:\r\n\r\nThe layers can now be saved as a GeoPackage. Click on the newly merged layer, go to Export > SavE Features As > and name the layer a good name (for example, Pemukiman Vector). Make sure GeoPAckage is selected as the format, and the chosen GeoPackage is the one in which the base layers are saved in.\r\nChange the “Geometry Type” to ’Polygon\" and uncheck the “Include Z-dimension”.\r\n\r\nRepeat this step for all other applicable layers that are in the “Polygon” format.\r\nProcessing Area Data - Tuplah\r\nFor Tuplah, we only need to filter the data that is to be selected.\r\nWe might need to fix the geometries, by using the “Fix Geometries” tool explained int he Polyline section.\r\nWe right click on the layer and select > Open Attribute Table. In the table that appears, click on “select by Expression” and run the following command:\r\nFor the agricultural layer: “Legenda” = ‘Hutan Tanaman’ or “Legenda” = ‘Pertanian Lahan Kering’ or “Legenda” = ‘Pertanian Lahan Kering Campur’ or “Legenda” = ‘Sawah’\r\nFor the forest layer: “Legenda” = ‘Hutan Lahan Kering Primer’ or “Legenda” = ‘Hutan Lahan Kering Sekunder’ or “Legenda” = ‘Hutan Mangrove Primer’ or “Legenda” = ‘Hutan Mangrove Sekunder’ or “Legenda”= ‘Hutan Rawa Sekunder’or “Legenda”= ’belukar’ or “Legenda”= ‘belukar rawa’\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we right click and save selected layer as a GeoPackage. Make sure the projection is changed to EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1).\r\nRepeat the same step for the agricultural layer.\r\nProcessing Point Data\r\nThe point data needs to be merged into a single layer for analysis.\r\nWe first open up the characteristic of concern, for example, toponimi layer (TOPONIMI_PT_50k).\r\nIn some layers, we are only interested in certain attributes. For example, for the Toponimi Layer, we are interested in the “Kantor Banks”. Therefore, some filters need to be applied.\r\nWe right click on the layer > Open Attribute Table.\r\nWe toggle the editing by clicking the pencil icon near the top of the window.\r\nFollowing that, we sort the table by “Remark” by clicking on it, and then selecting all the rows with attribute Remark = “Kantor Bank”.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then close the attribute table, and toggle editing on the Toponimi layer (or any other point layer of concern). Following that, we copy the selection, and paste it in a new scratch layer by going to Edit > Paste > Temporary Scratch Layer. It would be good practice to rename the temporary scratch layer for later (for e.g, KK Kantor Bank, PPU Kantor Bank etc)\r\nWe repeat all steps up till this one, for the same data of interest, for other regencies / cities.\r\nRepeat the steps above for the line data, in order to merge the layers:\r\nFirst, we select the layers that describe our attribute in question. Go to the Processing Toolbox and search for “Merge Vector Layers”, and select the layers which we have just added. For example, if we were working on the toponimi layer we would add in the temporary layers created previously e.g KK Kantor Bank, PPU Kantor Bank, KS Kantor Bank. We leave the CRS as is, and then run the algorithm.\r\n\r\nBefore saving the layer we need to take care of duplicate points since they might be represented multiple times. Go to the Processing Toolbox and search for “Delete Duplicate Geometries” When the window opens, we use the layer that we had just created in the previous step as the Input layer, and then run.\r\n\r\nAfter running, the duplicate geometries (For example, one bank at the same location might be represented by multiple points in different layers) should be removed. We can then save this layer in our GeoPackage file. Right click on the processed layer, select “Save Features As”, and make sure GeoPackage is selected in the window that comes up. Navigate to the GeoPackage that contains the base layer, and name our layer “AllBanks_Vector”, or for whatever attribute of interest that is being explored. Make sure the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 and the “Point” datatype is set in Geometry, as well as the “Include Z dimension” is unchecked, then save the newly formed layer.\r\n\r\nProcessing Point and Polygonal Data\r\nThis section should only be applicable to the airport layer, because the point data for airports comprise an additional airport that is not presented in the area data. It is important, because this missing airport is the new international airport for Samarinda and can absolutely not be eliminated from the study.\r\nThe general approach is to create a new polygon where the data is needed.\r\nImport the airport polygon and point layers. And view them. We see that there’s a point that doesn’t have a corresponding polygon, and a polygon inside Samarinda that is the decomissioned airport which has to be deleted.\r\n\r\nFor the point layer that we need to add a polygon to, we first toggle the editing by clicking on the pencil icon on the top bar.\r\n\r\nFollowing that we click on the “Add Polygon” next to it and draw it around the OSM layer boundary of the airport. To complete the shape we right click; to add a corner of the polygon we left click.\r\n\r\nOnce the shape is created an additional window will come out to enter the attributes. To know the attributes to add, we have to open the point layer attributes, so we toggle the Information tool and click on the point layer. A window will pop up with the attributes. We transfer the data in the NAMOBJ and REMARK column to the attributes of our newly created polygon. Then we click “OK”.\r\n\r\nTo remove the decommissioned airport, we click on the Select tool, move down to its location, select the airport and press the Delete key on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nAfter these 2 modifications are complete we then toggle editing off by clicking on the pncil button again then accepting the changes that are made.\r\nFollowing that, we follow the rest of the procedures in the Area Dataset processing in order to merge the vector layers together and then export them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Selection of Required Data\r\nTo create the heatmaps, we will be using the forest fire dataset and the final_shape shapefile.\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/shapefile-shp-titik-api-hotspot.html The forest hot spots.\r\nThe forest fire hot spot are split into 6 files of each year from 2014 - 2019. We will want to merge these layers into one shapefile that contains all the hotspot from eyar 2014 - 2019.\r\n2. Steps to create merged forest fire shapefile\r\nPut in all the forest fire layers (2014 - 2019) into QGIS.\r\nLook for the merge layers function by searching for ‘combine’.Open up the merge vector layers function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the input layers, put in FF_2014 to FF_2019.For Destination CRS, put in EPSG : 23845 DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 and then click on Run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new temporary layer would appear called ‘Merged’\r\nExport ‘Merged’ into a shapefile called CombinedFF and ensure the CRS is the same as step 3. Change geometry type to Point and uncheck the box where it says include z-dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get forest fire hotspots that are only in the study area. We first bring in the study area shapefile into QGIS.\r\nThen we use the Clip function. For the Input layer, we put in CombinedFF and the overlay layer as the shapefile for the study area (Final_shape). Then we click on run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA temporary layer would appear called Clipped. This will be our final shapefile/layer that we want\r\nExport that into a shapefile and call it Combined_FF. Ensure the CRS is the same as Step 3. This will be our final combined forest fire layer.\r\n3. Creating the heatmap\r\nMoving on to creating the heatmap for our forest fire layer. We first search ’heatmap’in the Processing Toolbox. Then click on Heatmap(Kernel Density Estimation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the point layer, put in ‘Combined_FF’ and for the Radius put in 10,000. For Pixel size Y and X put in 100 for both of them. Your final screen should look like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick Run. You should get a temporary layer called Heatmap as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExport the Heatmap as a Geopackage and ensure that the CRS is EPSG : 23845 DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1.\r\nNext, we will be changing the symbology of the layer. Click on Properties of the new Heatmap layer and then Symbology.\r\nChange the render type to ‘singleband pseudocolour’ and the colour ramp to ‘Red’. Once you are done, your screen should look like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on Apply and Ok. Your screen should look like this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We will get all the data here into a raster format for the next step under “Calculating Normalised Distance”.\r\nThere are several criteria to be used:\r\nDistance from river/coastline/natural disasters: We use the river layer (flooding) because there are no other avoidable natural disasters. Follow section 2.1.\r\nSlope: We use the slope layer generated from the DEM that was used for task 1, which is already rasterised. Hence no extra work to be done for this layer in this section.\r\nDistance from Airport: We use both vector layers that had been used to create the overlay maps for task 1, but buffered. Follow section 2.3.\r\nDistance from Urban Settlement: We use the Urban Settlements vector layer, clipped against the city boundaries. Follow section 2.4.\r\nDistance from Forest Fire: We use the forest fire heatmap layer that had been created in task 1.\r\nDistance from Road and Distance from Seaport: We use the road and seaport layers that we had prepared in task 1. Follow section 2.1.\r\nDistance from Forest: We use the forest vector layer. Follow section 2.2. ## Section 1.1. For all applicable layers We will need to add a POI_CODE field in the layer which we intend to rasterise.\r\n\r\nRight click on the layer > Open Attribute Table. In the window that opens, select “Create Calculated Field”.\r\n\r\nIn the window that opens, make sure ‘Create a New Field’ is selected. Enter “POI_CODE” into the field name and 1 into the box with the values. Then create the field by clicking on “Run”.\r\n\r\nTo verify that it is created correctly in the attribute table there should be an additional column that is named “POI_CODE” with all values inside being 1.\r\n\r\nSection 2.1. Preparing River Proximity and Road Proximity\r\nThere is no extra processing needed for these layers.\r\nGo to Processing Toolbox on the Right Hand Side of the page and select Rasterize.\r\n * We use a 100x100m grid. In the window that opens, we set the field to burn-in to POI_CODE, the units to “Georeferenced Units”, and the height and width to 100, as seen below. The layer extent will follow the shape of the study area, with the layer “FinalShape”.\r\n\r\nWhen all is done, press “Run” and a rasterised layer should come up.\r\n\r\nRepeat this exercise for the layers for River and Seaport.\r\nSection 2.2. Preparing Forest Layer\r\nThis forest layer should have been prepared in the data preparation for Task 1, under the “Area” data format in “Clipping Layers”, including the filtering of appropriate areas for analyses.\r\nRepeat the steps in section 2.1.\r\nSection 2.3. Preparing Distance from Airport\r\nBecause the airport demand a buffer that is about 3km for noise abatement procedures, the nearest suitable area from the airport should be at least 3km proximity. Therefore, we would need to create a buffer around the airport before rasterising the entire buffer.\r\nTo do this, go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Create Buffer. In the window that appears, select the airport vector layer.\r\nIn the resultant layer, ensure that the distance is set to 3000m, which would create a 3km buffer, and segments is set to 100, which would create a nice curved edge, instead of smaller values which woud result in a rectangle shaped buffer.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we click on “Run” to create a buffer. The result should look something like this.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we have to rasterise the layers. Now, we can continue with the steps as provided in section 2.1.\r\nSection 2.4. Preparing Distance from Settlement\r\nThis layer requires some clipping of the entire urban settlements layer, as has been prepared in task 1 under the “area type data”.\r\nWe will need to clip the urban settlements with respect to the city boundaries of Kota Balikpapan and Kota Samarinda.\r\nWe toggle the editing by clicking the pencil icon near the top of the window.\r\nFollowing that, we sort the table by “KAB_KOTA” by clicking on it, and then selecting all the rows with attribute KAB_KOTA = “KOTA BALIKPAPAN” or “KOTA_SAMARINDA”.\r\n\r\nWe then exit the attribute table, go to the top panel and toggle editing by clicking on the pencil button on the top bars. Then we press CTRL+C to copy the features that we have selected.\r\nWe paste the features in a temporary layer by going to Edit > Paste > Temporary Scratch Layer.\r\n\r\nWe should see something like this, where the city limits are shaded differently because they are now on a temporary layer.\r\n\r\nNow we can proceed with the clipping.\r\nWe now select the Urban Settlement layer.\r\nWe then go to Vector > Geoprocessing > Clip and select the temporary layer with the city limits as the overlay layer, and the urban settlement layer as the input layer.\r\n\r\nWe then click on “Run”. We should see that the urban settlement vector layer contains only those that are within the city limits.\r\n\r\nWe can then proceed with following the steps from section 2.1, to rasterise the layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Objective:\r\nThe objective of this section is to create raster layers and further using the raster layers to create proximity maps (distance) as well as to normalise the values of the proximity map in order to accurate derive selection criteria analysis from it.\r\n2. Getting Started\r\nYou will learn how to create raster and proximity map layers.before that, we will be installing a plugin called serval. Serval is a Raster editing tools, you can select and apply a modification to a chosen part of a raster.\r\nClick on plugin > search “Serval”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick Install, you should be able to see it downloaded similar to the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 Importing raster GIS data layer\r\nUnder the Layer tab > select Add Layer > Raster Layer. The data source manager window will pop up. From source: select under the Provinsi Kalimantan Timur folder, import DEM SRTM 30M KALIMANTAN TIMUR.tif into the qGIS project.\r\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing previous steps, save the layer into geopackage format and rename the file as DEM, change CRS to project CRS, change the layer resolution to 100width and 100 height. Once ready, click on save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext we will use Serval to select the DEM layer and change the values\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 Working with SAGA clip raster with polygon\r\nFrom processing toolbox under SAGA, select clip raster with polygon. Input DEM inside and polygon select Final_shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is to clip the DEM so that it will be aligned to the final_shape of our Study Area.\r\n\r\nDIY: Once done, save the DEM layer as Geopackage and rename it as ClippedDEM\r\n\r\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Computing proximity to layers\r\nAfter creating DEM layers, we will now learn how to use raster GIS operation to derive analytical layers from the original geographic layers.\r\nUsing QGIS’ Closeness (Raster Distance) function, generate a proximity to roads layer. However, we must first rasterise the roads layer before proceeding with the computation. This is because the Proximity (Raster Distance) function requires a raster input GIS layer.\r\n3.1 Creating attribute field for rasterising\r\nBefore we can rasterise the roads layer, we need to add a control attribute field in the roads layer.\r\nAt the Layers panel, right-click on Roads layer > Open Attribute Table. The attribute table of roads layer will appear.\r\nFrom the menu bar of roads layer attribute table, click on Open field calculator icon.The Field Calculator dialog window appears.\r\nKeep Create a new field option checks. For Output field name, type POI_CODE. At the Expression pane, type 1. Your screen should look similar to the figure below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on OK button to run the function.\r\nYou will notice that a new field called POI_CODE has been added into the attribute table of roads GIS layer. Also note that all the records are indicated with POI_CODE values equals to 1. Save the editing. Now we are now ready to rasterize the roads layer.\r\n4.0 Rasterizing road layer\r\nFrom the menu bar, select Raster -> Conversion -> Rasterise (Vector to Raster).The Raster (Vector to Raster) dialog window appears.\r\nFor Input layer, select Roads from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Field to use for a burn-in value, select POI_CODE from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Output raster size units, select Georeferenced units.\r\nKeep both horizontal and vertical resolutions at 100 (meaning 100m by 100m resolution).\r\nFor Output extent, click on Calculate from Layer.\r\nSelect DEM from the drop-down list.\r\nWhen you are ready, click on Run button.\r\nWhen the operation ended, the dialog window will display the operation log. Make it a good practice to read the output display to ensure that the process has completed without any error. After confirming that there is no error. You can close the dialog window.\r\nYou should see a screen similar to this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIY: Using the steps you have learned in previous section, save the temporary layer into GeoPackage format. Call the newly exported layer raster_roads. Next, remove the temporary layer from QGIS.\r\n\r\n4.1 Working with Proximity function of QGIS\r\nNow, the Proximity operation of QGIS will be used to compute the proximity to roads layer. For the menu bar, select Raster -> Analysis <- Proximity (Raster Distance). The Proximity (Raster Distance) dialog window appears.\r\nFor Input layer, select raster_roads from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Distance units, select Georeferenced coordinates from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.\r\nClick on Run button.\r\n\r\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned, Clip the proximity map to Final_shape and save the newly computed proximity map into GeoPackage format with a resolution of 100m x 100m. Call the layer prox_road.\r\n\r\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can move on to normalization of the map layer.\r\n4.2 Clipping proximity map to study area\r\nAt the Search pane of Geoprocessing Toolbox panel, type ‘Clip Raster by Mask Layer’. Double-click on Clip Raster by Mask Layer. The dialog window of Clip Raster by Mask Layer appears.\r\nFor the input layer of the Clip Raster by Mask Layer window, put in prox_road. For the mask layer, put in final_area.\r\nFor the Source CRS and Target CRS, ensure that both of them are EPSG : 23845 DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1.\r\nFor the section ‘Assign a specific nodata value to output bands [optional]’, change it to 99999999. Your screen should look like this :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are done, click on ‘Run’. A new layer called Clipped by Mask Layer would appear. Save it as a geopackage and call it clippedprox_road.\r\n4.3 Working with Raster Calculator function of QGIS\r\nAt the Search pane of Geoprocessing Toolbox panel, type ‘raster calculator’. Double-click on Raster calculator of Raster analysis. The dialog window of Raster Calculator appears.\r\nAt the Layers panel of Raster Calculator dialog window, double-click on clippedprox_road, it will appear in the expression. Select the divide key “/” and input the maximum value of the layer you are using. In this case for roads is “13263.8613281250”\r\nRemember to add in reference layer such as the final_shape as well as change CRS type into Project CRS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce ready, click on Run.\r\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned previously, Save the output into GeoPackage format. Called the output layer road_raster_prox.\r\nYou should see the values normalised now similar to the screen below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0 Working with Proximity function of QGIS\r\n\r\nDIY: Using the steps you learnt in this section, replicate the steps to create raster layers and normalised proximity map layers for:\r\nsettlements\r\nforest\r\nairport\r\nseaport\r\nforest_fire\r\nrivers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
