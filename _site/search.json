The plan is part of a strategy to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub.

      "contents": "\r\n1. Preparation of Road Layers\r\nIn the OSM layer selected, we need to filter out the Primary, secondary and tertiary roads for analysis.\r\nImport the road layer that we had created before using the process.\r\nWe need to filter by the road attributes. Right click ont he road layer and select > “open attribute table”.\r\nIn the attribute table, we select the road concerned using the following commands by clicking on the “Select by Expression” menu:\r\nPRimary and Trunk: “fclass” = ‘motorway’ or “fclass” = ‘motorway_link’ or “fclass” = ‘trunk’ or “fclass” = ‘trunk_link’ or “fclass” = ‘primary’ or “fclass” = ‘primary_link’\r\nSecondary and Tertiary: “fclass” = ‘secondary or “fclass” = ’secondary_link’ or “fclass” = ‘tertiary’ or “fclass” = ‘tertiary_link’\r\n\r\n\r\nWe verify the roads have been selected; there should be elements selected in the table:\r\n\r\nWe save the layers as a GeoPackage layer. Right click on the layer with the selection > Save Selected Attributes As. In the window that pops up, select the GeoPackage for the project but save the layer as “Primary Roads”\r\nRepeat all the above steps for “secondary and tertiary” roads.\r\n2. Visualisation of Road Layers\r\nTo see the hierarchy better, colour the motorways and primary roads yellow and increase their width. Right Click on the “Primary Road” layer and go to “Symbology” on the panel that opens. Click on the “Simple Line” and in the window that opens,\r\nchange the colour to a dark shade of blue.\r\nchange the stroke width to 0.8mm.\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeat the previous step for the other 2 layers (Secondary and Tertiary roads, and all roads)\r\nThe colour for secondary roads should be a dark shade of green with a width of 0.5mm\r\nThe colour for other roads should be a dark brown with a width of 0.3mm\r\n\r\nFollowing that, follow instructions to plot road density below.\r\n3. Visualising Road Density\r\nFor the site survey analysis, a plot of road length against fixed distance will be used to visualise road density.\r\nFirst, we need to merge adjacent road segments together in order to prevent the number of intersections from being overstated. We first go to Vector >Geoprocessing > Dissolve, and in the window that opens, select the OSM road layer as the input layer.\r\n\r\nIn the reuslting temporary layer, open the dissolved layer’s atribute table, there should only be one row of data.\r\nFollowing that, we go to the Processing Toolbox on the bottom righthand corner, and search for “Multipart to Singlepart”\r\n\r\nIn the resulting window, just select the newly dissolved layer and click “Run”.\r\n\r\nThe final layer that is created, would be soon utilised to create density map. We save the single roads as a new layer in the GeoPackage file.\r\nWe can then create a grid. Go to Vector > Research Tools > Create Grid. Fill up the attributes as according to the below image. Make sure distance is set to 5000m, and then the shape type should be a hexagon.\r\n\r\nEach cell of the grid is a unit in which the density of the road network there will be calculated, with the measure of the density being length / 5x5km hexagonal area.\r\nwe also need to clip the grid to the study area. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip on the top bar and select the input layer as the temporary grid layer an the bottom layer as the study area layer as defined before, following the screenshot and then click run.\r\n\r\nThe completed grid should look like this.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we use the Vector > Analysis Tools > Sum Lines Length to calculate the total length of the lines in the polygon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nHeading 1\r\nCreating Proximity Maps\r\nImporting Necessary Data and Merging Geographies\r\nWe need to ensure that the data which we are utilising, is in a raster format, and we need to clip out unnecessary points.\r\nFor the selected layer, go to Vector > Geoprocessing > Clip, and select the study area Final_shape as the overlay layer, and the input layer as desired (for example, for airports, it will be AIRPORT_PT_50K). After creating, a temporary layer Clipped should be produced.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\nSince this has to be repeated for all the 4 regencies, we repeat step 2 for all the same type of amenity (airport / bus terminal / road etc).\r\nAfter that, we would combine all 4 clipped layers together to create a single layer, for ease of analysis. First, we have to remove any duplicate points by scanning the map. Where a point or a polygon is duplicated, we use the select tool to click on the point concerned, and then remove the point by using the Delete tool.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\nIt would be good practice to rename the layers, as they would all carry the same name even though they are at different regency. For example, in preparing the proximity map for the airport, the layer names Balikpapan Airport Raster, Kartanegara Airport Raster and PPU Airport Raster layer were used. If we are interested in only a subset (a specific category) of points/polygons then move on to step 4a, to filter out those points which are not needed.\r\n5aa. If we are interested in only a subset/ specific category of data within the entire point layer, then we need to remove the rows which we are not concerned about. For example, for the layer TOPONIMI_PT_50k, we are interested only in the banks “Kantor Bank”. Therefore we right click on the layer > Open Attribute Table and then we toggle the editing by clicking the pencil icon near the top of the window. Following that, we sort the table by “Remark” by clicking on it, and then selecting all the rows with attribute Remark = “Kantor Bank”.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\n5ab. Following that, we create another temporary layer by closing the attribute table, pressing CTRL+C to copy the selection, then going to Edit > Paste Selected Features > Temporary scratch Layer to paste it in a temporary layer. After this is done, move to step 6\r\n{fig.width = 50px}““”\r\n5ba. When dealing with line data, such as in the case of the road layer, there are some roads which may be disjointed or incomplete. This should have been taken into account when doing Task 1, but if it is not done, follow the section “Data Processing with Line Data” ~~~ this should be moved to task 1\r\nWe go to the Vector > Merge Vector Layers and then select the layers which we intend to merge in the resulting layer. For example, for airports, I selected Balikpapan Airport Raster, Kartanegara Airport Raster and PPU Airport Raster layer then click “OK” after that to merge.\r\nhi6a. NB: Step 6 can only be done if all the data is of the same type (polygon vs polygon, line vs line). If the data is of a different type, for example, polygon and point, a buffer would have to be created on the point dataset. This happens when creating the airport layer, because certain airports are represented only in the polygon layer and certain other airports are represented only in the point layer.\r\n6b. To do this, we first have to save the polygon layer and point layer with the correct projected coordinate system. SO for each layer we right click > Save selected Features as, and save as a byGeoPackage layer. Be sure to change the CRS to EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and always save as layers to the same GeoPackage file. We also would need to change the datatype to Polygon and Point from PolygonZ and PointZ respectively, by opening the “Geometry” drop-down and make sure the data type is set either to Polygon and Point and the “Include Z Dimension” is not checked.\r\n6c. Now, click on the newly saved GeoPackage layer containing the point data. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tool > Buffer. In the resultant window, make a buffer of 100m x 100m by changing the distance to 100m and the units to meters, and make the resultant buffer square by changing the segments to 2.\r\nhi6d. The resulting temporary layer would be in a Polygon format. Now, we will get all data to be in polygons and we can save the data in step 5 to merge and continue on with step 6 to save.\r\nSave the merged vector dataset in a GeoPackage layer, with CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and ensure that the Geometry data type is set to “Polygon” and the Include Z dimension is not checked.\r\nData Processing with Line Data\r\n(Put in a new page? YES - THIS SHOUD BE WITH TASK 1 INSTRUCTIONS.)\r\nIn the raw data gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp, there are some roads which are incomplete, for example roads which go above the bridge. This will result in the intersection points being overstated. While it may not be possible to fix every road, most roads where this issue presents itself, are located along the coast.\r\nQgis has a function to join the road segments together. Open the original road layer gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp and immediately save it as a GeoPackage layer with the correct CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and make sure under the “Geometry” tab, the data type is changed to “Line” and the “Include Z values” is not checked.\r\nFollowing that, toggle editing on the layer by clicking on the pencil icon. Make sure the selection method is “Select Features” and not other selection methods.\r\nSelect the 2 road segments that are supposed to be joined together.\r\nhiClick on “Merge Selected Features” in order to merge the 2 line segments together to form a single feature, which we can then extend in order to touch the 2 edges of the line.\r\nhiPost-merge we have to re-select the merged segment which has become a single feature by clicking on the line segment. Following that we click on the “Reshape Feature”.\r\nhiWe click on the edge of one line and then drag it to the start of the other line, this will join the 2 line segments together to form a complete road.\r\n 8. Repeat this for different layers concerned.\r\nRastering Merged Vector Layers\r\nWe need to add in burn-in values. To do that, right-click on the newly created vector layer and go to “Open Attribute Table”. When the attribute table opens, toggle editing by pressing pencil icon on the top of window and then go to the button which is called “Open Field Calculator”.\r\nIn the resultant window set the field name to POI_CODE, the data type to “Integer” and enter in the field calculator “1”. Then create the new field.\r\nhiFollowing which, go to the Processing Toolbox on the right hand side of the window and click on “Rasterize (vector to raster” after typing in “Rasterize” into the searchbar.\r\n 8. In the resultant window make the following changes. The input layer should be the vector (be it polyline, polygon or point) layer that has the location of the desired amenities for the entire study area (therefore merged using the previous steps), in this case “AllBanks_Vector” for the banks. The field to use should be POI_CODE and the raster size units should be “Georeferenced Units”, while the resolution should be 100 for both vertical and horizontal. The output extent should be the polygonal layer for the study area, in this case “Final_Shape”.\r\nClick “Run” to run and make sure that the layer has been rasterised. Zoom in to the areas which are marked as points in the input vector layer (e.g AllBanks_Vector) and verify that the raster layer has been added correctly - there should be a small black square.\r\n 10. Repeat all the previous steps for all layers of interest in the investigation:\r\nAirports - AIRPORT_LN_50K and AIRPORT_PT_50k (both line and polygon)\r\nBanks - TOPONIMI_PT_50k (need to filter out all those Remarks != Kantor Bank rows)\r\nRoads - gis_osm_road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n1. Population and Demographic\r\n1.1 Population Density by District\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly the most densely populated areas are located near the urban centres of Samarinda and Balikpapan, with the general trend of areas becoming less densely populated the further inland. However, the area north of Samarinda, and between Balikpapan and Samarinda, stands out as having population density of around 36-125 people per square kilometre. These places have some form of human settlement around them but are not too densely populated indicating the presence of highly urbanised areas.\r\nThe region that had the highest proportion of adults are close to Kota Balikpapan, at areas Prapatan (56.7%), Telaga Sari (56.1%), Telemow, Gunungsari Ilir and Damai Baru (all at 56%). Generally, however, as highlighted by the dark green areas, which indicate regions with the highest proportion of adults of 54.5% to 67.7%, most of those areas are clustered near the cities of Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan, while the areas with the smallest proportion of adults, at 46.5% to 50.1%, are located in the outlying regions, for example Santan Ulu in the north of the study region, Tani Baru in the east near the river delta, and Penajam, near the Southwest. These percentages are significant because they provide insight into the demographics of the region - a place with a higher proportion of adults would likely have a larger workforce, after controlling for the population density. Places with higher proportion of seniors or elderly, who are not considered economically productive, would mean more social support needed to empower them, and thus be a less suitable location.\r\nProp. of AdultsSupplementing the previous point, a survey was also conducted on the proportion of seniors in the study area. It was found that the proportion of seniors ranged from only 1.7% to 11.7%. The highest proportions were found in areas indicated by the dark blue on the map where the proportion ranged from 5.7% to 11.7%. There was no particular geographic distribution for these highest proportions, which were Desa Argo Sari (11.7%), Lung Anai (9.3%), Pelabuhan (8.9%), Sungai Bawang (8.6%) and Bukit Raya (8.5%). Generally, there is also no specific trend in the geographical distribution of seniors, except that most of the areas with more seniors are clustered north of Balikpapan.\r\nProp. of Seniors2. Economic and Businesses\r\n2.1 Agriculture\r\nThe overall distribution of agricultural areas is shown as below:\r\n ### 2.1.1 Sawah - Integrated Rice or Paddy Field\r\nAgrisawah, or paddy fields, are found mostly within the area of Samarinda as well as Kutai Kartanegara regency, close to the Mahakam River. We hypothesise that the low-lying area, makes it susceptible to floods and thus it becomes a better region to have rice paddies. This contrasts with the relatively higher-lying area in Balikpapan and even south, which would be more suited for conventional crops that do not require an extremely large amount of water.\r\n2.1.2 Forest Plantation\r\nMost forest plantations are found within the inner area at higher elevation, possibly because they take longer to grow and are more vulnerable to damage caused by floods.\r\n2.1.3 Dryland and Mixed Dryland Farming\r\nDryland and mixed dryland farming are found closer to the coast, distributed relatively evenly throughout the study area, though they tend to cluster on the city fringes of both Kota Balikpapan and Kota Samarinda which are highlighted grey. This is not very surprising given that the farms are likely to serve people living in the city.\r\n2.2 Mining\r\n\r\nMining areas are mostly close to the coast, south of Samarinda. They are especially common at the Sanga Sanga district. Upon further research, the area close to Sanga Sanga has had various disagreements and protests among villages as a result of the mining activities. Furthermore, companies that had left the area did not fill up mine pits, causing floods and terrain damage whenever it rains and reducing the suitability of the land for other activities.\r\nhttps://www-mongabay-co-id.translate.goog/2018/08/18/tolak-perusahaan-tambang-warga-sanga-sanga-upacara-kemerdekaan-indonesia-di-area-konsesi/?_x_tr_sl=id&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-GB&_x_tr_pto=nui https://betahita-id.translate.goog/news/detail/6080/forum-sanga-sanga-tutup-tambang-pt-abn-pulihkan-lingkungan.html.html?_x_tr_sl=id&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui,sc\r\n2.2 Commerce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit easily generates various employment opportunities in other areas such as transport and logistics, banking, and retail. Commerce overall is an essential component of national development and wealth creation.\r\nIn our analysis, the distribution of commerce is correlated to urban settlements in the study area. The darker shades are those with more commerce in place. We should pick an area that has existing commerce so that we can boost economic development in that area.\r\n3. Transport and Communication\r\n3.1 Airports\r\n\r\nExcluding decommissioned airports, there are 4 airports that are around the study area. Most of the airports are located close to the coast. Most of the airport runways are also in the north-eastern and south-western direction, presumably to take advantage of the direction of monsoon winds.\r\nFrom northerly to southerly, the airports are:\r\nBandara Tanjung Santan: The runway is in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction. However, the airport appears to be decommissioned from Google satellite images, although the infrastructure appears to still be present.\r\nMuara Badak Pujangan Airport: The runway is in the heading of 01 and 19, and is owned by the LNG company Badak NGL, suggesting that it’s not used for regular flights.\r\nAji Pangeran Tumenggung Pranoto International Airport: The main airport in Samarinda; the runway is in heading of 40/220 and it serves exclusively domestic destinations with a range of flights by 7 airlines. The runway is 2.25 km long.\r\nSultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Sepinggan Airport: The airport in Balikpapan. It is the busiest airport in Kalimantan province and again has domestic flights to other Indonesian locations. Its 2.5km runway is in headings of 70 and 250.\r\n3.2 Bus Terminals\r\n\r\nThe bus terminals are located within the major cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda, with two of them being outside the city limits. The first bus terminal outside those city limits is the terminal in Tenggarong, the regency capital of Kudai Kartanegara. The second bus terminal outside those city limits is the terminal in Muara Jawa on the Eastern coast, which connects to a seaport, which has routes to Pare Pare, Sulawesi.\r\n3.3 Seaports\r\n\r\nThere are several seaports, wharves and harbours stretching from the coast to inland. Both cities Samarinda and Balikpapan have a system of wharves within the rivers that run through the middle of the city. There are also seaports near the bus terminal in Muara Jawa, which connect to other Indonesian islands such as Sulawesi. Some ports, namely one at Tanjung Santan, have been removed because they are primarily for LPG cargo and are privately owned , and not for passenger use.\r\n3.4 Roads\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Infrastructure\r\n4.1 Infrastructure - Buildings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExisting Infrastructure such as buildings plays an important role as it shows the necessary buildings needed for people to live in. We have analysed the distribution of buildings throughout the area. The darker shades are those with more building infrastructure in place.\r\nThere are various pros and cons to consider when picking an area that has this basic infrastructure in place. Pros: Basic infrastructure buildings able to pick up the development process more quickly. Cons: Certain infrastructure may require demolition to make way for more development.\r\n4.2 Infrastructure - Electricity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectricity plays an important role and is a necessity in everyday life. We have analysed the distribution of electricity and power throughout the area. The darker shades are those with more electricity infrastructure in place. We should pick an area that has this basic infrastructure in place.\r\n4.3 Infrastructure - Water Supply (distributors)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater is a requisite resource for business. Without regular or continuous access to clean water, businesses either have to raise prices, shut down or both. Industries that rely on water for operations or manufacturing are the most vulnerable and most at risk.\r\nThe study analyzes the location and distribution of water supply (distributors) in the Study Area. We should pick an area that is accessible to water supply to keep operations running.\r\n5. Environment and Hazard\r\n5.1 Forest Fire\r\nTo measure the extent and severity of forest fires from 2014-2019, counts of forest fires were being added to each polygon (districts) on the study area GIS map. The intensity of red signifies the number of forest fires that occurred in each polygon/district from 2014-2019, where the higher intensity of red signifies high frequency of forest fires while a lighter shade of red indicates lower frequency of forest fires happening in the district. White would be used to indicate no forest fires occurred in that district from 2014-2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2 Earthquake\r\nWe mapped out the seismic waves from the recent 2021 Sulawesi earthquake of magnitude of 6.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is higher tendency of earthquake in Sulawesi as major fault lines are found there which gives rise to earthquakes (https://geoscienceletters.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40562-021-00197-5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile our study area is not near the epicenter of the earthquake, we can see that the seismic waves are able to be felt in our study area. We can see that the seismic waves are coming from the coastal area in the western side of our study area. This may give rise to potential typhoons and/or tsunamis due to the seismic waves.\r\n5.3 Major rivers with digital elevation\r\nFor digital elevation, the DEM map gave a range of -77m under sea level to 635m above sea level. We would want to avoid areas with low elevation and especially if it is close to water bodies (lakes and rivers) so as to avoid flash floods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirstly, we made any area below sea level as blue to signify that these areas are either filled with water or are extremely likely to. After doing some research (i will link), we realised that there is no optimal altitude for cities. However, areas with less than 10m above sea level are considered dangerously low-lying and susceptible to flash floods. Hence we considered anything below 10m as dangerous (red) and anything above 100m would be considered safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also added layers of all major rivers and lakes in our study area and changed all their colours to dark blue. We can see that the areas around the lakes and rivers are mostly low-lying with elevation of around 10m. Unsurprisingly, the coastal areas of the study area are all below 10m elevation and the elevation would get higher the further we are from the coastal areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northern region of the study area, while does have some area well above 50m, is surrounded by a large portion of low lying area Even close proximity around smaller streams are not suitable for settlements as the elevation is around 15m which would still run the risk of a flash flood during heavy rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

General rules for choropleth mapping are as follows:\r\nUse data that are assumed to be uniform throughout an enumeration unit.\r\nBecause enumeration units vary in size, do not map totals. Use derived values, such as ratios, rates, proportions, or percentages.\r\nThe best classing method depends on the data, the map reader and the purpose of the map.\r\nWhen classifying data, the full range of data must be included and class values should not overlap. No more than six classes are recommended.\r\nClass symbols (i.e. colors or patterns) must be easily distinguishable.\r\nUsing the INTERSECT_NIAGA (Commerce) layer, we can see that it’s in point format. When creating the choropleth map, we like to see if the overall distribution in the study area.\r\nNavigate to Processing Toolbox > Count Points in Polygon\r\nIn Polygon, select Final_Shape (The shape used as basemap for our Study Area)\r\nIn Points, select All_Commerce (The points that you want to count)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that you should skip invalid geometry to ensure smooth process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce everything is in Order, click on Run. It is also a good habit to look through the Logs to ensure there are no errors in the process.\r\nOnce it has successfully run, you will notice that there are a temporary file name Count, and if you check the table attributes, you are able to see that each polygon has a new column appended to it called num_points.

Selection of Required Data\r\nThe datasets that are being used for the project include:\r\nTopographical data from here: https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html. Data of Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda, Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara are to be downloaded.\r\nThe https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/download-shapefile-shp-batas-desa.html comprises the population and demographic data.

Data was downloaded for Indonesia as a whole, and only the road layer was kept.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and opening the data, we had to examine individual layers and see what is to be kept.\r\nThe topographical data layer:\r\nAirports: AIRPORTS_LN_50K and AIRPORTS_PT_50k\r\nToponimi (Miscellaneous items): TOPONIMI_PT_50k\r\nDifferent forms of agriculture: AGRIKEBUN_AR_50k, AGRILADANG_AR_50k, AGRISAWAH_AR_50k\r\nDifferent forms of forestry: NONAGRIALANG_AR_50k, NONAGRIHUTANBASAH_AR_50k, NONAGRISEMAKBELUKAR_AR_50k, NONAGRIHUTANKERING_AR_50K\r\nRoads: JALAN_LN_50k\r\nSettlements: PEMUKIMAN_AR_50k\r\nBus Terminals: TERMINALBUS_PT_50k\r\nMining Areas: TAMBANG_AR_50k\r\nNB: The topographical dataset .zip files comprises these layers for every regency/area (i.e one each for Kutai Kartanegara, one for Kota Balikpapan etc etc, with the same names)\r\n\r\nThe demographic layer for Kalimantan Timur:\r\nJust 1 layer which is kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the topographical map layer, we would have to merge the datasets showing different natural/artificial features to supplement, and clip the layers to within the study area.\r\nFor each of those layers, we would combine the layers that show the same attribute.\r\n\r\nThe study area to be used is derived from the population and demographic layer.\r\nImport the shapefile into Qgis by double clicking on it.\r\nWe need to select the suitable study area since the layer would contain the regencies, districts and sub-districts for the entire province of East Kalimantan. Right click on the layer, open Attribute Table and first we filter by the “KAB_KOTA” column. Open the “Select Fetures using an Expression” field and enter the following: “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KUTAI KARTANEGARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA BALIKPAPAN’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘PENAJAM PASER UTARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA SAMARINDA’.\r\nIn the resultant selected layers, we toggle editing on the layer and then copy the selected areas and paste it as a temporary layer by going to Edit > Paste Features As > Temporary Scractch Layer.\r\nRepeat the second step, but with the filtering by the specific districts as mentioned in the project brief:\r\nAll sub-districts and district of Kota Balipapan, Kota Samarinda\r\nKutai Kartanegara: Anggana, Loa Janan, Loa Kulu, Marang Kayu, Muara Jawa, Samboja, Sanga Sanga, Sebulu Tenaggarong, Tenggarong Seberang and Muara Badak.\r\nNorth Penajam Paser (Penajam Paser Utara) Regency: Babulu, Penajam, Sepaku and Waru.\r\nWe can manually select the districts and sub-districts by sorting by the “KECAMATAN” column. We select all the districts and sub-districts that do NOT fall into the ones listed above, and then invert the selection using the invert selection tool.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we save the selection into a new GeoPackage layer, by closing the attribute table window, right-clicking on the layer which we made the selection on, and click “Save Selected Features As”. If this is the first feature to be included into the GeoPackage file, create a new GeoPackage file, and name the layer “Final Shape”.\r\nFor the following analyses, there are some geometrical errors which we have to be fixed.\r\nTo fix this, go to the Processing > Toolbox on the right and search for Fixed Geometries.\r\n\r\nSelect the newly imported layer and press “OK” in the resultant window.\r\nhiSave the resultant layer in a GeoPackage format. Click on the newly created temporary layer, go to Export > Save Features As. In the resultant window, select the format GeoPackage and then create a new GeoPAckage file. Name the layer “FinalShape_Fixed geometries”, leave all other features as intended, before saving.\r\n\r\n\r\nClipping Layers into Study Area\r\nThe processing of each layer will differ according to their data type. We have sorted the layers that have been used into the following categories:\r\nPoints\r\nTOPONIMI_PT_50k\r\nTERMINALBUS_PT_50k\r\nForest Fire\r\nCommerce\r\nElectricity and Network: GENLISTRIK: Electricity, KABELLISTRIK: Power cable, MENARALISTRIK: Electric Tower, MENARATELPON: Tower Phone, PANCARTV: TV Transmitter, PANCARRADIO: Radio Transmitter\r\nWater Supply (Distributors)\r\nArea\r\nMining Areas\r\nNon-Agricultural Forest Areas\r\nAgricultural Areas\r\nSettlements\r\nMixed\r\nAirport (Both point and area)\r\nLines\r\nRoads (gis_osm_roads)\r\nProcessing Polyline (Road Layer)\r\nImport the layer (gis_osm_roads_a_free.shp).\r\nThere is a need to join incomplete roads. Examine each road segment closely and find out which road segments can be joined, for example roads which go above the bridge.\r\nThis will result in the intersection points being overstated when conducting site survey analysis. While it may not be possible to fix every road, most roads where this issue presents itself, are located along the coast or over bridges.\r\n\r\nWe need to clip the road to the study area. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip, make sure the newly imported road layer is input as the Input Layer, and the layer to be used as a clip is the FinalShape_Fixed geometries layer (Overlay Layer)that had been prepared.\r\nhiSave the temporary layer as a GeoPackage layer with the correct CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and make sure under the “Geometry” tab, the data type is changed to “Line” and the “Include Z values” is not checked.\r\nFollowing that, toggle editing on the layer by clicking on the pencil icon. Make sure the selection method is “Select Features” and not other selection methods.\r\nSelect the 2 road segments that are supposed to be joined together.\r\nhiClick on “Merge Selected Features” in order to merge the 2 line segments together to form a single feature, which we can then extend in order to touch the 2 edges of the line.\r\nhiPost-merge we have to re-select the merged segment which has become a single feature by clicking on the line segment. Following that we click on the “Reshape Feature”.\r\nhiWe click on the edge of one line and then drag it to the start of the other line, this will join the 2 line segments together to form a complete road.\r\nhiRepeat this for all segments that have been found to have missing road segments.\r\nhiRemove all the previous temporary layers created by right clicking on them and selecting “Delete Selected Layer”.\r\nSave the newly created road layer by right clicking on it in the menu and selecting Save Features As, and in the resultant box that comes up, ensure that the GeoPackage file that the base map layer was selected, is selected under the file name and the layer name is set to “Roads”, and the map CRS is set to EPSG:23845.\r\n\r\nProcessing Area (Polygon) Data\r\nThe area data needs to be merged into a single layer for analysis.\r\nWe first open up the characteristic of concern, for example, agricultural shrub layer.\r\n\r\nhiFollowing that, we need to clip the layers so that they only overlap our area of study. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip, make sure the newly imported road layer is input as the Input Layer, and the layer to be used as a clip is the FinalShape_Fixed geometries layer (Overlay Layer)that had been prepared.\r\n*NB: If the geometries are invalid it is required to use the “Fix Geometries” tool from the Processing > Toolbox (CTRL+ALT+T) befire moving forward with the analysis.\r\n\r\nImage was used to process road section data but the methodology is the sameThe completed, clipper layers should look like this:\r\nhiThe different areas then need to be combined together. Go to the Processing toolbox on the bottom right hand corner of the page and select “Merge vector layers”.\r\nIn the resulting window, select the desired layers to be merged, for example:\r\n * We keep the CRS as it is; we will change the CRS when we export as a GeoPackage.\r\nAfter merging, the layers should appear as this:\r\nhiThe layers can now be saved as a GeoPackage. Click on the newly merged layer, go to Export > SavE Features As > and name the layer a good name (for example, MergedShrubs). Make sure GeoPAckage is selected as the format, and the chosen GeoPackage is the one in which the base layers are saved in.\r\nChange the “Geometry Type” to ’Polygon” and uncheck the “Include Z-dimension”.\r\nhiRepeat this step for all other applicable layers that are in the “Polygon” format.\r\nProcessing Point Data\r\nThe point data needs to be merged into a single layer for analysis.\r\nWe first open up the characteristic of concern, for example, toponimi layer (TOPONIMI_PT_50k).\r\nIn some layers, we are only interested in certain attributes. For example, for the Toponimi Layer, we are interested in the “Kantor Banks”. Therefore, some filters need to be applied.\r\nWe right click on the layer > Open Attribute Table.\r\nWe toggle the editing by clicking the pencil icon near the top of the window.\r\nFollowing that, we sort the table by “Remark” by clicking on it, and then selecting all the rows with attribute Remark = “Kantor Bank”.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\n\r\nWe then close the attribute table, and toggle editing on the Toponimi layer (or any other point layer of concern). Following that, we copy the selection, and paste it in a new scratch layer by going to Edit > Paste > Temporary Scratch Layer. It would be good practice to rename the temporary scratch layer for later (for e.g, KK Kantor Bank, PPU Kantor Bank etc)\r\nWe repeat all steps up till this one, for the same data of interest, for other regencies / cities.\r\nRepeat the steps above for the line data, in order to merge the layers:\r\nFirst, we select the layers that describe our attribute in question. Go to the Processing Toolbox and search for “Merge Vector Layers”, and select the layers which we have just added. For example, if we were working on the toponimi layer we would add in the temporary layers created previously e.g KK Kantor Bank, PPU Kantor Bank, KS Kantor Bank. We leave the CRS as is, and then run the algorithm.\r\nhiBefore saving the layer we need to take care of duplicate points since they might be represented multiple times. Go to the Processing Toolbox and search for “Delete Duplicate Geometries” When the window opens, we use the layer that we had just created in the previous step as the Input layer, and then run.\r\nhiAfter running, the duplicate geometries (For example, one bank at the same location might be represented by multiple points in different layers) should be removed. We can then save this layer in our GeoPackage file. Right click on the processed layer, select “Save Features As”, and make sure GeoPackage is selected in the window that comes up. Navigate to the GeoPackage that contains the base layer, and name our layer “AllBanks_Vector”, or for whatever attribute of interest that is being explored. Make sure the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 and the “Point” datatype is set in Geometry, as well as the “Include Z dimension” is unchecked, then save the newly formed layer.\r\nhiProcessing Point and Polygonal Data\r\nThis section should only be applicable to the airport layer, because the point data for airports comprise an additional airport that is not presented in the area data. It is important, because this missing airport is the new international airport for Samarinda and can absolutely not be eliminated from the study.\r\nThe general approach is to create a new polygon where the data is needed.\r\nImport the airport polygon and point layers. And view them. We see that there’s a point that doesn’t have a corresponding polygon, and a polygon inside Samarinda that is the decomissioned airport which has to be deleted.\r\nhiFor the point layer that we need to add a polygon to, we first toggle the editing by clicking on the pencil icon on the top bar.\r\nhiFollowing that we click on the “Add Polygon” next to it and draw it around the OSM layer boundary of the airport. To complete the shape we right click; to add a corner of the polygon we left click.\r\nhiOnce the shape is created an additional window will come out to enter the attributes. To know the attributes to add, we have to open the point layer attributes, so we toggle the Information tool and click on the point layer. A window will pop up with the attributes. We transfer the data in the NAMOBJ and REMARK column to the attributes of our newly created polygon. Then we click “OK”.\r\nhihiTo remove the decommissioned airport, we click on the Select tool, move down to its location, select the airport and press the Delete key on the keyboard.\r\nhiAfter these 2 modifications are complete we then toggle editing off by clicking on the pncil button again then accepting the changes that are made.\r\nFollowing that, we follow the rest of the procedures in the Area Dataset processing in order to merge the vector layers together and then export them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Selection of Required Data\r\nTo create the heatmaps, we will be using the forest fire dataset and the final_shape shapefile.\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/shapefile-shp-titik-api-hotspot.html The forest hot spots.\r\nThe forest fire hot spot are split into 6 files of each year from 2014 - 2019. We will want to merge these layers into one shapefile that contains all the hotspot from eyar 2014 - 2019.\r\n2. Steps to create merged forest fire shapefile\r\nPut in all the forest fire layers (2014 - 2019) into QGIS.\r\nLook for the merge layers function by searching for ‘combine’.Open up the merge vector layers function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the input layers, put in FF_2014 to FF_2019.For Destination CRS, put in EPSG : 23845 DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 and then click on Run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new temporary layer would appear called ‘Merged’\r\nExport ‘Merged’ into a shapefile called CombinedFF and ensure the CRS is the same as step 3. Change geometry type to Point and uncheck the box where it says include z-dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get forest fire hotspots that are only in the study area. We first bring in the study area shapefile into QGIS.\r\nThen we use the Clip function. For the Input layer, we put in CombinedFF and the overlay layer as the shapefile for the study area (Final_shape). Then we click on run\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA temporary layer would appear called Clipped. This will be our final shapefile/layer that we want\r\nExport that into a shapefile and call it Combined_FF. Ensure the CRS is the same as Step 3. This will be our final combined forest fire layer.\r\n3. Creating the heatmap\r\nMoving on to creating the heatmap for our forest fire layer. We first search ’heatmap’in the Processing Toolbox. Then click on Heatmap(Kernel Density Estimation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the point layer, put in ‘Combined_FF’ and for the Radius put in 10,000. For Pixel size Y and X put in 100 for both of them. Your final screen should look like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick Run. You should get a temporary layer called Heatmap as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExport the Heatmap as a Geopackage and ensure that the CRS is EPSG : 23845 DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1.\r\nNext, we will be changing the symbology of the layer. Click on Properties of the new Heatmap layer and then Symbology.\r\nChange the render type to ‘singleband pseudocolour’ and the colour ramp to ‘Red’. Once you are done, your screen should look like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on Apply and Ok. Your screen should look like this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
