      "contents": "\r\nHeading 1\r\nCreating Proximity Maps\r\nImporting Necessary Data and Merging Geographies\r\nWe need to ensure that the data which we are utilising, is in a raster format, and we need to clip out unnecessary points.\r\nFor the selected layer, go to Vector > Geoprocessing > Clip, and select the study area Final_shape as the overlay layer, and the input layer as desired (for example, for airports, it will be AIRPORT_PT_50K). After creating, a temporary layer Clipped should be produced.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\nSince this has to be repeated for all the 4 regencies, we repeat step 2 for all the same type of amenity (airport / bus terminal / road etc).\r\nAfter that, we would combine all 4 clipped layers together to create a single layer, for ease of analysis. First, we have to remove any duplicate points by scanning the map. Where a point or a polygon is duplicated, we use the select tool to click on the point concerned, and then remove the point by using the Delete tool.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\nIt would be good practice to rename the layers, as they would all carry the same name even though they are at different regency. For example, in preparing the proximity map for the airport, the layer names Balikpapan Airport Raster, Kartanegara Airport Raster and PPU Airport Raster layer were used. If we are interested in only a subset (a specific category) of points/polygons then move on to step 4a, to filter out those points which are not needed.\r\n5aa. If we are interested in only a subset/ specific category of data within the entire point layer, then we need to remove the rows which we are not concerned about. For example, for the layer TOPONIMI_PT_50k, we are interested only in the banks “Kantor Bank”. Therefore we right click on the layer > Open Attribute Table and then we toggle the editing by clicking the pencil icon near the top of the window. Following that, we sort the table by “Remark” by clicking on it, and then selecting all the rows with attribute Remark = “Kantor Bank”.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\n5ab. Following that, we create another temporary layer by closing the attribute table, pressing CTRL+C to copy the selection, then going to Edit > Paste Selected Features > Temporary scratch Layer to paste it in a temporary layer. After this is done, move to step 6\r\n\"\"“{fig.width = 50px}”\"\"\r\n5ba. When dealing with line data, such as in the case of the road layer, there are some roads which may be disjointed or incomplete. This should have been taken into account when doing Task 1, but if it is not done, follow the section “Data Processing with Line Data” ~~~ this should be moved to task 1\r\nWe go to the Vector > Merge Vector Layers and then select the layers which we intend to merge in the resulting layer. For example, for airports, I selected Balikpapan Airport Raster, Kartanegara Airport Raster and PPU Airport Raster layer then click “OK” after that to merge.\r\nhi6a. NB: Step 6 can only be done if all the data is of the same type (polygon vs polygon, line vs line). If the data is of a different type, for example, polygon and point, a buffer would have to be created on the point dataset. This happens when creating the airport layer, because certain airports are represented only in the polygon layer and certain other airports are represented only in the point layer.\r\n6b. To do this, we first have to save the polygon layer and point layer with the correct projected coordinate system. SO for each layer we right click > Save selected Features as, and save as a byGeoPackage layer. Be sure to change the CRS to EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and always save as layers to the same GeoPackage file. We also would need to change the datatype to Polygon and Point from PolygonZ and PointZ respectively, by opening the “Geometry” drop-down and make sure the data type is set either to Polygon and Point and the “Include Z Dimension” is not checked.\r\n6c. Now, click on the newly saved GeoPackage layer containing the point data. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tool > Buffer. In the resultant window, make a buffer of 100m x 100m by changing the distance to 100m and the units to meters, and make the resultant buffer square by changing the segments to 2.\r\nhi6d. The resulting temporary layer would be in a Polygon format. Now, we will get all data to be in polygons and we can save the data in step 5 to merge and continue on with step 6 to save.\r\nSave the merged vector dataset in a GeoPackage layer, with CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and ensure that the Geometry data type is set to “Polygon” and the Include Z dimension is not checked.\r\nData Processing with Line Data\r\n(Put in a new page? YES - THIS SHOUD BE WITH TASK 1 INSTRUCTIONS.)\r\nIn the raw data gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp, there are some roads which are incomplete, for example roads which go above the bridge. This will result in the intersection points being overstated. While it may not be possible to fix every road, most roads where this issue presents itself, are located along the coast.\r\nQgis has a function to join the road segments together. Open the original road layer gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp and immediately save it as a GeoPackage layer with the correct CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and make sure under the “Geometry” tab, the data type is changed to “Line” and the “Include Z values” is not checked.\r\nFollowing that, toggle editing on the layer by clicking on the pencil icon. Make sure the selection method is “Select Features” and not other selection methods.\r\nSelect the 2 road segments that are supposed to be joined together.\r\nhiClick on “Merge Selected Features” in order to merge the 2 line segments together to form a single feature, which we can then extend in order to touch the 2 edges of the line.\r\nhiPost-merge we have to re-select the merged segment which has become a single feature by clicking on the line segment. Following that we click on the “Reshape Feature”.\r\nhiWe click on the edge of one line and then drag it to the start of the other line, this will join the 2 line segments together to form a complete road.\r\n 8. Repeat this for different layers concerned.\r\nRastering Merged Vector Layers\r\nWe need to add in burn-in values. To do that, right-click on the newly created vector layer and go to “Open Attribute Table”. When the attribute table opens, toggle editing by pressing pencil icon on the top of window and then go to the button which is called “Open Field Calculator”.\r\nIn the resultant window set the field name to POI_CODE, the data type to “Integer” and enter in the field calculator “1”. Then create the new field.\r\nhiFollowing which, go to the Processing Toolbox on the right hand side of the window and click on “Rasterize (vector to raster” after typing in “Rasterize” into the searchbar.\r\n 8. In the resultant window make the following changes. The input layer should be the vector (be it polyline, polygon or point) layer that has the location of the desired amenities for the entire study area (therefore merged using the previous steps), in this case “AllBanks_Vector” for the banks. The field to use should be POI_CODE and the raster size units should be “Georeferenced Units”, while the resolution should be 100 for both vertical and horizontal. The output extent should be the polygonal layer for the study area, in this case “Final_Shape”.\r\nClick “Run” to run and make sure that the layer has been rasterised. Zoom in to the areas which are marked as points in the input vector layer (e.g AllBanks_Vector) and verify that the raster layer has been added correctly - there should be a small black square.\r\n 10. Repeat all the previous steps for all layers of interest in the investigation:\r\nAirports - AIRPORT_LN_50K and AIRPORT_PT_50k (both line and polygon)\r\nBanks - TOPONIMI_PT_50k (need to filter out all those Remarks != Kantor Bank rows)\r\nRoads - gis_osm_road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Selection of Required Data\r\nThe datasets that are being used for the project include:\r\nTopographical data from here: https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html. Data of Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda, Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara are to be downloaded.\r\nThe https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/download-shapefile-shp-batas-desa.html comprises the population and demographic data. Data for Kalimantan Timur province was downloaded.\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/download-dem-srtm-30-meter-se-indonesia.html The digital elevation model at 30m resolution\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/03/download-data-shapefile-shp-geologi-se.html The geological data.\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/shapefile-shp-titik-api-hotspot.html The forest hot spots.\r\nhttps://download.geofabrik.de/asia/indonesia.html Indonesia OSM Data. Data was downloaded for Indonesia as a whole, and only the road layer was kept.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and opening the data, we had to examine individual layers and see what is to be kept.\r\nThe topographical data layer:\r\nAirports: AIRPORTS_LN_50K and AIRPORTS_PT_50k\r\nToponimi (Miscellaneous items): TOPONIMI_PT_50k\r\nDifferent forms of agriculture: AGRIKEBUN_AR_50k, AGRILADANG_AR_50k, AGRISAWAH_AR_50k\r\nDifferent forms of forestry: NONAGRIALANG_AR_50k, NONAGRIHUTANBASAH_AR_50k, NONAGRISEMAKBELUKAR_AR_50k, NONAGRIHUTANKERING_AR_50K\r\nRoads: JALAN_LN_50k\r\nSettlements: PEMUKIMAN_AR_50k\r\nBus Terminals: TERMINALBUS_PT_50k\r\nMining Areas: TAMBANG_AR_50k\r\nNB: The topographical dataset .zip files comprises these layers for every regency/area (i.e one each for Kutai Kartanegara, one for Kota Balikpapan etc etc, with the same names)\r\n\r\nThe demographic layer for Kalimantan Timur:\r\nJust 1 layer which is kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the topographical map layer, we would have to merge the datasets showing different natural/artificial features to supplement, and clip the layers to within the study area.\r\nFor each of those layers, we would combine the layers that show the same attribute.\r\n\r\nThe study area to be used is derived from the population and demographic layer.\r\nImport the shapefile into Qgis by double clicking on it.\r\nWe need to select the suitable study area since the layer would contain the regencies, districts and sub-districts for the entire province of East Kalimantan. Right click on the layer, open Attribute Table and first we filter by the “KAB_KOTA” column. Open the “Select Fetures using an Expression” field and enter the following: “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KUTAI KARTANEGARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA BALIKPAPAN’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘PENAJAM PASER UTARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA SAMARINDA’.\r\nIn the resultant selected layers, we toggle editing on the layer and then copy the selected areas and paste it as a temporary layer by going to Edit > Paste Features As > Temporary Scractch Layer.\r\nRepeat the second step, but with the filtering by the specific districts as mentioned in the project brief:\r\nAll sub-districts and district of Kota Balipapan, Kota Samarinda\r\nKutai Kartanegara: Anggana, Loa Janan, Loa Kulu, Marang Kayu, Muara Jawa, Samboja, Sanga Sanga, Sebulu Tenaggarong, Tenggarong Seberang and Muara Badak.\r\nNorth Penajam Paser (Penajam Paser Utara) Regency: Babulu, Penajam, Sepaku and Waru.\r\nWe can manually select the districts and sub-districts by sorting by the “KECAMATAN” column. We select all the districts and sub-districts that do NOT fall into the ones listed above, and then invert the selection using the invert selection tool.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we save the selection into a new GeoPackage layer, by closing the attribute table window, right-clicking on the layer which we made the selection on, and click “Save Selected Features As”. If this is the first feature to be included into the GeoPackage file, create a new GeoPackage file, and name the layer “Final Shape”.\r\nFor the following analyses, there are some geometrical errors which we have to be fixed.\r\nTo fix this, go to the Processing > Toolbox on the right and search for Fixed Geometries.\r\n\r\nSelect the newly imported layer and press “OK” in the resultant window.\r\nhiSave the resultant layer in a GeoPackage format. Click on the newly created temporary layer, go to Export > Save Features As. In the resultant window, select the format GeoPackage and then create a new GeoPAckage file. Name the layer “FinalShape_Fixed geometries”, leave all other features as intended, before saving.\r\n\r\n\r\nClipping Layers into Study Area\r\nThe processing of each layer will differ according to their data type. We have sorted the layers that have been used into the following categories:\r\nPoints\r\nTOPONIMI_PT_50k\r\nTERMINALBUS_PT_50k\r\nForest Fire\r\nArea\r\nMining Areas\r\nNon-Agricultural Forest Areas\r\nAgricultural Areas\r\nSettlements\r\nMixed\r\nAirport (Both point and area)\r\nLines\r\nRoads (gis_osm_roads)\r\nProcessing Polyline (Road Layer)\r\nImport the layer (gis_osm_roads_a_free.shp).\r\nThere is a need to join incomplete roads. Examine each road segment closely and find out which road segments can be joined, for example roads which go above the bridge.\r\nThis will result in the intersection points being overstated when conducting site survey analysis. While it may not be possible to fix every road, most roads where this issue presents itself, are located along the coast or over bridges.\r\n\r\nWe need to clip the road to the study area. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip, make sure the newly imported road layer is input as the Input Layer, and the layer to be used as a clip is the FinalShape_Fixed geometries layer (Overlay Layer)that had been prepared.\r\nhiSave the temporary layer as a GeoPackage layer with the correct CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and make sure under the “Geometry” tab, the data type is changed to “Line” and the “Include Z values” is not checked.\r\nFollowing that, toggle editing on the layer by clicking on the pencil icon. Make sure the selection method is “Select Features” and not other selection methods.\r\nSelect the 2 road segments that are supposed to be joined together.\r\nhiClick on “Merge Selected Features” in order to merge the 2 line segments together to form a single feature, which we can then extend in order to touch the 2 edges of the line.\r\nhiPost-merge we have to re-select the merged segment which has become a single feature by clicking on the line segment. Following that we click on the “Reshape Feature”.\r\nhiWe click on the edge of one line and then drag it to the start of the other line, this will join the 2 line segments together to form a complete road.\r\nhiRepeat this for all segments that have been found to have missing road segments.\r\nPreparing Intersection Point Map\r\nFor the site survey analysis, a plot of road intersection density will be used to measure the road density in a particular area.\r\nFirst, we need to merge adjacent road segments together in order to prevent the number of intersections from being overstated. We first go to Vector >Geoprocessing > Dissolve, and in the window that opens, select the OSM road layer as the input layer.\r\nhiIn the reuslting temporary layer, open the dissolved layer’s atribute table, there should only be one row of data.\r\nFollowing that, we go to the Processing Toolbox on the bottom righthand corner, and search for “Multipart to Singlepart”\r\nhiIn the resulting window, just select the newly dissolved layer and click “Run”.\r\nhiThe final layer that is created, would be soon utilised to create an intersection.\r\nWe click on that layer, go to the PRocessing Toolbox on the right hand side and search for “Line Intersections”. Open the tool and select both the input and intersect layer as the recently created layer from the previous step.\r\nhihiWe need to first remove any duplicate intersections to clean the layer data a bit further. We will go to the Processing Toolbox at the bottom right hand corner of the page, and then search for “Delete Duplicate Geometries”. When the window opens, we use the layer that we had just created in the previous step as the Input layer, and then run.\r\nhiRemove all the previous temporary layers created by right clicking on them and selecting “Delete Selected Layer”.\r\nSave the newly created intersection layer by right clicking on the point layer and selecting Save Features As, and in the resultant box that comes up, ensure that the GeoPackage file that the base map layer was selected, is selected under the file name and the layer name is set to “Intersections”, and the map CRS is set to EPSG:23845.\r\n\r\nProcessing Area (Polygon) Data\r\nThe area data needs to be merged into a single layer for analysis.\r\nWe first open up the characteristic of concern, for example, agricultural shrub layer.\r\n\r\nhiFollowing that, we need to clip the layers so that they only overlap our area of study. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip, make sure the newly imported road layer is input as the Input Layer, and the layer to be used as a clip is the FinalShape_Fixed geometries layer (Overlay Layer)that had been prepared.\r\n*NB: If the geometries are invalid it is required to use the “Fix Geometries” tool from the Processing > Toolbox (CTRL+ALT+T) befire moving forward with the analysis.\r\n\r\nImage was used to process road section data but the methodology is the sameThe completed, clipper layers should look like this:\r\nhiThe different areas then need to be combined together. Go to the Processing toolbox on the bottom right hand corner of the page and select “Merge vector layers”.\r\nIn the resulting window, select the desired layers to be merged, for example:\r\n * We keep the CRS as it is; we will change the CRS when we export as a GeoPackage.\r\nAfter merging, the layers should appear as this:\r\nhiThe layers can now be saved as a GeoPackage. Click on the newly merged layer, go to Export > SavE Features As > and name the layer a good name (for example, MergedShrubs). Make sure GeoPAckage is selected as the format, and the chosen GeoPackage is the one in which the base layers are saved in.\r\nChange the “Geometry Type” to ’Polygon\" and uncheck the “Include Z-dimension”.\r\nhiRepeat this step for all other applicable layers that are in the “Polygon” format.\r\nProcessing Point Data\r\nThe point data needs to be merged into a single layer for analysis.\r\nWe first open up the characteristic of concern, for example, toponimi layer (TOPONIMI_PT_50k).\r\nIn some layers, we are only interested in certain attributes. For example, for the Toponimi Layer, we are interested in the “Kantor Banks”. Therefore, some filters need to be applied.\r\nWe right click on the layer > Open Attribute Table.\r\nWe toggle the editing by clicking the pencil icon near the top of the window.\r\nFollowing that, we sort the table by “Remark” by clicking on it, and then selecting all the rows with attribute Remark = “Kantor Bank”.\r\n{fig.width = 50px}\r\n\r\nWe then close the attribute table, and toggle editing on the Toponimi layer (or any other point layer of concern). Following that, we copy the selection, and paste it in a new scratch layer by going to Edit > Paste > Temporary Scratch Layer. It would be good practice to rename the temporary scratch layer for later (for e.g, KK Kantor Bank, PPU Kantor Bank etc)\r\nWe repeat all steps up till this one, for the same data of interest, for other regencies / cities.\r\nRepeat the steps above for the line data, in order to merge the layers:\r\nFirst, we select the layers that describe our attribute in question. Go to the Processing Toolbox and search for “Merge Vector Layers”, and select the layers which we have just added. For example, if we were working on the toponimi layer we would add in the temporary layers created previously e.g KK Kantor Bank, PPU Kantor Bank, KS Kantor Bank. We leave the CRS as is, and then run the algorithm.\r\nhiBefore saving the layer we need to take care of duplicate points since they might be represented multiple times. Go to the Processing Toolbox and search for “Delete Duplicate Geometries” When the window opens, we use the layer that we had just created in the previous step as the Input layer, and then run.\r\nhiAfter running, the duplicate geometries (For example, one bank at the same location might be represented by multiple points in different layers) should be removed. We can then save this layer in our GeoPackage file. Right click on the processed layer, select “Save Features As”, and make sure GeoPackage is selected in the window that comes up. Navigate to the GeoPackage that contains the base layer, and name our layer “AllBanks_Vector”, or for whatever attribute of interest that is being explored. Make sure the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 and the “Point” datatype is set in Geometry, as well as the “Include Z dimension” is unchecked, then save the newly formed layer.\r\nhiProcessing Point and Polygonal Data\r\nThis section should only be applicable to the airport layer, because the point data for airports comprise an additional airport that is not presented in the area data. It is important, because this missing airport is the new international airport for Samarinda and can absolutely not be eliminated from the study.\r\nThe general approach is to convert the Point layer to a Polygon type through the creation of a “buffer” and extend th buffer polygon to cover the entire airport.\r\nImport the airport polygon and point layers. And view them. We see that there’s a point that doesn’t have a corresponding polygon, and a polygon inside Samarinda that is the decomissioned airport which has to be deleted.\r\nhiTo first add the additional point we generate a buffer by going to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Buffer and\r\nThen select the point layer as the buffer to be added, and the unit to be “Georeferenced Units”, and the dimensions to be 100m x 100m. Make the resultant buffer square by changing the segments to 2.\r\nhiThen, click on Run, and a temporary buffer layer should be generated.\r\n6b. To do this, we first have to save the polygon layer and point layer with the correct projected coordinate system. SO for each layer we right click > Save selected Features as, and save as a byGeoPackage layer. Be sure to change the CRS to EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and always save as layers to the same GeoPackage file. We also would need to change the datatype to Polygon and Point from PolygonZ and PointZ respectively, by opening the “Geometry” drop-down and make sure the data type is set either to Polygon and Point and the “Include Z Dimension” is not checked.\r\n6c. Now, click on the newly saved GeoPackage layer containing the point data. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tool > Buffer. In the resultant window, make a buffer of 100m x 100m by changing the distance to 100m and the units to meters, and make\r\n6d. The resulting temporary layer would be in a Polygon format. Now, we will get all data to be in polygons and we can save the data in step 5 to merge and continue on with step 6 to save.\r\nSave the merged vector dataset in a GeoPackage layer, with CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and ensure that the Geometry data type is set to “Polygon” and the Include Z dimension is not checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Data was downloaded for Indonesia as a whole, and only the road layer was kept.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and opening the data, we had to examine individual layers and see what is to be kept.\r\nThe topographical data layer:\r\nAirports: AIRPORTS_LN_50K and AIRPORTS_PT_50k\r\nToponimi (Miscellaneous items): TOPONIMI_PT_50k\r\nDifferent forms of agriculture: AGRIKEBUN_AR_50k, AGRILADANG_AR_50k, AGRISAWAH_AR_50k\r\nDifferent forms of forestry: NONAGRIALANG_AR_50k, NONAGRIHUTANBASAH_AR_50k, NONAGRISEMAKBELUKAR_AR_50k, NONAGRIHUTANKERING_AR_50K\r\nRoads: JALAN_LN_50k\r\nSettlements: PEMUKIMAN_AR_50k\r\nBus Terminals: TERMINALBUS_PT_50k\r\nMining Areas: TAMBANG_AR_50k\r\nNB: The topographical dataset .zip files comprises these layers for every regency/area (i.e one each for Kutai Kartanegara, one for Kota Balikpapan etc etc, with the same names)\r\n\r\nThe demographic layer for Kalimantan Timur:\r\nJust 1 layer which is kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the topographical map layer, we would have to merge the datasets showing different natural/artificial features to supplement, and clip the layers to within the study area.\r\nFor each of those layers, we would combine the layers that show the same attribute.\r\n\r\nThe study area to be used is derived from the population and demographic layer.\r\nImport the shapefile into Qgis by double clicking on it.\r\nWe need to select the suitable study area since the layer would contain the regencies, districts and sub-districts for the entire province of East Kalimantan. Right click on the layer, open Attribute Table and first we filter by the “KAB_KOTA” column. Open the “Select Fetures using an Expression” field and enter the following: “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KUTAI KARTANEGARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA BALIKPAPAN’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘PENAJAM PASER UTARA’ or “KAB_KOTA” = ‘KOTA SAMARINDA’.\r\nIn the resultant selected layers, we toggle editing on the layer and then copy the selected areas and paste it as a temporary layer by going to Edit > Paste Features As > Temporary Scractch Layer.\r\nRepeat the second step, but with the filtering by the specific districts as mentioned in the project brief:\r\nAll sub-districts and district of Kota Balipapan, Kota Samarinda\r\nKutai Kartanegara: Anggana, Loa Janan, Loa Kulu, Marang Kayu, Muara Jawa, Samboja, Sanga Sanga, Sebulu Tenaggarong, Tenggarong Seberang and Muara Badak.\r\nNorth Penajam Paser (Penajam Paser Utara) Regency: Babulu, Penajam, Sepaku and Waru.\r\nWe can manually select the districts and sub-districts by sorting by the “KECAMATAN” column. We select all the districts and sub-districts that do NOT fall into the ones listed above, and then invert the selection using the invert selection tool.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, we save the selection into a new GeoPackage layer, by closing the attribute table window, right-clicking on the layer which we made the selection on, and click “Save Selected Features As”. If this is the first feature to be included into the GeoPackage file, create a new GeoPackage file, and name the layer “Final Shape”.\r\nFor the following analyses, there are some geometrical errors which we have to be fixed.\r\nTo fix this, go to the Processing > Toolbox on the right and search for Fixed Geometries.\r\n\r\nSelect the newly imported layer and press “OK” in the resultant window.\r\nhiSave the resultant layer in a GeoPackage format. Click on the newly created temporary layer, go to Export > Save Features As. In the resultant window, select the format GeoPackage and then create a new GeoPAckage file. Name the layer “FinalShape_Fixed geometries”, leave all other features as intended, before saving.\r\n\r\n\r\nClipping Layers into Study Area\r\nThe processing of each layer will differ according to their data type. We have sorted the layers that have been used into the following categories:\r\nPoints\r\nTOPONIMI_PT_50k\r\nTERMINALBUS_PT_50k\r\nForest Fire\r\nArea\r\nMining Areas\r\nNon-Agricultural Forest Areas\r\nAgricultural Areas\r\nSettlements\r\nMixed\r\nAirport (Both point and area)\r\nLines\r\nRoads (gis_osm_roads)\r\nProcessing Polyline (Road Layer)\r\nImport the layer (gis_osm_roads_a_free.shp).\r\nThere is a need to join incomplete roads. Examine each road segment closely and find out which road segments can be joined, for example roads which go above the bridge.\r\nThis will result in the intersection points being overstated when conducting site survey analysis. While it may not be possible to fix every road, most roads where this issue presents itself, are located along the coast or over bridges.\r\n\r\nWe need to clip the road to the study area. Go to Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Clip, make sure the newly imported road layer is input as the Input Layer, and the layer to be used as a clip is the FinalShape_Fixed geometries layer (Overlay Layer)that had been prepared.\r\nhiSave the temporary layer as a GeoPackage layer with the correct CRS as EPSG:23845 (DGN / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1) and make sure under the “Geometry” tab, the data type is changed to “Line” and the “Include Z values” is not checked.\r\nFollowing that, toggle editing on the layer by clicking on the pencil icon. Make sure the selection method is “Select Features” and not other selection methods.\r\nSelect the 2 road segments that are supposed to be joined together.\r\nhiClick on “Merge Selected Features” in order to merge the 2 line segments together to form a single feature, which we can then extend in order to touch the 2 edges of the line.\r\nhiPost-merge we have to re-select the merged segment which has become a single feature by clicking on the line segment. Following that we click on the “Reshape Feature”.\r\nhiWe click on the edge of one line and then drag it to the start of the other line, this will join the 2 line segments together to form a complete road.\r\nhiRepeat this for all segments that have been found to have missing road segments.\r\nFor the site survey analysis, a plot of road intersection density will be used to measure the road density in a particular area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
